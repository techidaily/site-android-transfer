The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Itel P55 device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure.
