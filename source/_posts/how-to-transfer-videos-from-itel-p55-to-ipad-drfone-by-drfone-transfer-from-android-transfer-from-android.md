### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Itel P55 device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space.

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure.
