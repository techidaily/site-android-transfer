## Part 5. 2 Methods To Transfer Contacts From iPhone to Android

This section will discuss two methods to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android. Similarly, in this iPhone-to-Android transfer case, the iPhone synchronization method and importing VCF file method can be used to move your contact list.

### Method 1. Enable iPhone Sync Feature

You can enable the iPhone Sync feature to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android device. In this case, ensure the contacts option in the Gmail synchronization is toggled on. Later, the contacts are saved when you sign in with the same Google account on your Samsung Galaxy M54 5G. Let's learn **how to transfer from phone to phone using this feature**:

**Note:** You can select "Add Account,” tap “Google," and input your credentials if your account has not been added yet.

- **Step 2.** Now, you have to install or access the “Google One” app on your Samsung Galaxy M54 5G. Sign in and configure your Google One settings. Then, navigate to the “Sync” section and tap the “View” option.
