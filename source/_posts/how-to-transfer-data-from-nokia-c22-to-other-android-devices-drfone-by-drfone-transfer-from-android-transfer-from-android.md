## Part 2. How to Transfer Music from Nokia C22 to iPod with Move to iOS App

For those looking to transfer music from an Android device to an iPod, the Move to iOS app provides a user-friendly solution.

While this app is designed for iOS devices, this approach is limited to iPod touch models and may not be compatible with all iPod devices. Users with older iPod models may need to explore alternative methods for transferring music between devices, which we will introduce in the next section.

Before starting the transfer, you need to download and install the Move to iOS app on the Google Play Store. Now, how to transfer music from Nokia C22 to iPod:

**Step 1:** Set Up Your iPod:

As you set up your iPod for the first time, reach the "Apps & Data" screen and choose "Move Data from Android."

**Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions

Open Move to iOS on your Nokia C22. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

**Step 3:** Enter the Code

On your iPod, a six to ten-digit code will be displayed. Enter this code when prompted on your Nokia C22.

**Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer

In the Move to iOS app, choose "Music" to transfer your music files specifically. Then, tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

**Step 5:** Transfer complete.

Allow the app to complete the transfer process. Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPod. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process.
