## Can I Transfer iPod Music to Android?

**Can you transfer music from an iPod to an Android phone**? Despite the fact that the iPod is an Apple product, transferring its music to an Android device is indeed possible. Apple's ecosystem may be renowned for its exclusivity, but with the right methods, you can seamlessly bridge the gap between your iPod and an Android device.

One of the most straightforward ways to transfer music from your iPod to an Android device is by using Bluetooth. It's worth noting that Bluetooth transfer capability is present in all iPod Touch models but not in older iPod models. Bluetooth support for iPod Touch was introduced with the 2nd Generation and iOS 3.0, while iPod Nano gained support from the 7th Generation onward.

Alternatively, other methods involve employing a dedicated app and third-party software as an intermediary. Rest assured; the upcoming sections will comprehensively cover these approaches, providing you with the necessary guidance for a smooth music transfer process.

## Part 1. Transfer Music from iPod to Android via Bluetooth

Bluetooth technology serves as a versatile means for wirelessly connecting devices, and in this case, it provides a convenient avenue for transferring music from your iPod to an Android device. This wireless approach simplifies the process, allowing for seamless data exchange between the two devices.

But first, you still need to check Bluetooth compatibility. Ensure that both your iPod and Android devices can do Bluetooth transfer. This method is also applicable when you wonder **how to download music from an iPod to an Android phone**.

**Step 1:** Enable Bluetooth on both Devices.

On your iPod, navigate to the Settings menu and select Bluetooth. Enable Bluetooth on the Android device by accessing its settings as well. Make sure that you have set both devices to discoverable mode.

**Step 2:** Pair the HTC U23 Pro devices.

Search for available Bluetooth devices on your HTC U23 Pro, and select your iPod from the list. Likewise, confirm the pairing request on your iPod.

**Step 3**: Initiate file transfer.

Once paired, locate the music files on your iPod that you wish to transfer. Use the sharing or send via Bluetooth option (this may vary depending on your iPod model) to send the selected music files to your HTC U23 Pro.

**Step 4:** Accept the files on Android.

Accept the incoming Bluetooth transfer request from the iPod. The music files will then be transferred wirelessly from your iPod to the Android device.

**Step 5**: Verify transfer success.

Confirm the successful transfer by checking the music library on your HTC U23 Pro. The transferred songs should now be available and ready to play.

## Part 2. How to Transfer Music from HTC U23 Pro to iPod with Move to iOS App

For those looking to transfer music from an Android device to an iPod, the Move to iOS app provides a user-friendly solution.

While this app is designed for iOS devices, this approach is limited to iPod touch models and may not be compatible with all iPod devices. Users with older iPod models may need to explore alternative methods for transferring music between devices, which we will introduce in the next section.

Before starting the transfer, you need to download and install the Move to iOS app on the Google Play Store. Now, how to transfer music from HTC U23 Pro to iPod:

## How to sync Android with Outlook?

Now, I’d like to introduce you how to transfer Android contacts to Outlook. Download this free trial version on your computer. Then check out the easy steps below.

### Step 1. Connect Android phone with a computer and run Dr.Fone

To start with, connect your HTC U23 Pro with a computer either via a USB cable. Run Dr.Fone on your computer and choose Transfer fron the main window Then, your HTC U23 Pro will be detected instantly. After that, the primary window will appears like the screenshot shows below.

### Step 2. Android to Outlook sync

Then, click "Contacts" under "Information" panel on the top. In the contact management window, choose the contacts that you want to export. Click "Export" button. When the drop-down menu pops up, you can either click "Export selected contacts to computer" or "Export all contacts to computer". After that, click "to Outlook Express" or "to Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013". Then, the contract transferring begins. Be sure your HTC U23 Pro is connected all the time.

As you see, apart from exporting Android contacts to Outlook, you can also copy contacts from HTC U23 Pro to vCard, Windows Live Mail and Windows Address Book. If you have a Gmail account, you’re able to export Android contacts to your computer, and then backup these Android contacts to your Gmail account too.
