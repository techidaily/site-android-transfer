## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Honor Magic Vs 2 to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Honor Magic Vs 2 before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Honor Magic Vs 2, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

Samsun Galaxy S21 has 4000 mAh battery capacity, Galaxy S21 Plus comes in 4800 mAh, and Galaxy S21 Ultra has 5000 mAh. So, comparatively, Galaxy S21 Ultra has the best quality battery. The charging system is the same for all of these three models. It needs 25W on a wired connection. You can also charge them wireless on 15W.

**Connectivity:**

In these three models, you will get 5G. So, there is no argument about this. However, Galaxy S21 Plus and S21 Ultra have been manufactured with Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) chips. It is a new feature that will provide hands-free control. Using these features, you can unlock your car or find the SmartTag tracker. Among these, S21 Ultra offers you more. It has Wi-Fi 6E compatibility, which is the fastest and lowest latency for Wi-Fi connection.

**Important Note:** New Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has new software to transfer all files to another device, called Smart switch. This feature is used for keeping the backup and restoring the files. Though it is good software, it has many cons. So, before using that app, check these cons.

- Smart Switch has a low-speed transfer problem. It shows up when you transfer data with wireless connectivity.
- After transferring the data, the smart switch does not back up the data. It is quite hard to recover the data using this app.
- Using the Smart Switch app, you can only transfer the data from Samsung to Samsung. You can't use it for other devices.
