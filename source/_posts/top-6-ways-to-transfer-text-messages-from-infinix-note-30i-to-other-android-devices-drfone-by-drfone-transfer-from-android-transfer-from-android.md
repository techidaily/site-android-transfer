![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30i to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Infinix Note 30i devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Infinix Note 30i, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30i to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Infinix Note 30i to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Infinix Note 30i to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30i to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg)

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Infinix Note 30i, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

Since Infinix Note 30i is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Infinix Note 30i, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Infinix Note 30i to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Infinix Note 30i to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Infinix Note 30i Migrate if you are a Infinix Note 30i user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Infinix Note 30i devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Infinix Note 30i device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Infinix Note 30i models are now unable to run Infinix Note 30i Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Infinix Note 30i to iPhone besides Infinix Note 30i Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Infinix Note 30i Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Infinix Note 30i to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Infinix Note 30i and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Infinix Note 30i and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Infinix Note 30i device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Infinix Note 30i device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Infinix Note 30i device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Infinix Note 30i phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.
