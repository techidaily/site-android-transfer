**Step 2. Connect Phones and select files**

Connect your Android and iPhone. Dr.Fone will detect it soon. Then select the files and click Start Transfer. It can transfer almost all files, contacts, apps, messages, photos, music, videos, etc. If you just want to transfer contacts from Lava Blaze Pro 5G to iPhone, then it is also ok. Just check the Contacts option to transfer contacts from Lava Blaze Pro 5G to iPhone easily.
