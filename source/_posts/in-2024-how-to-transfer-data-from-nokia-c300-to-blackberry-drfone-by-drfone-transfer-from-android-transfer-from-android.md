## Option 1: Issues about transferring data from Nokia C300 to BlackBerry

When transferring data from Nokia C300 to BlackBerry, you can’t use Bluetooth or a third party software that will help you speed up the process. And unfortunately, you will sometimes wish that you can speed up this process. You can try to manually transfer data from Nokia C300 to a computer, and then from a computer to BlackBerry, but this process can take hours. It is boring to transfer the files from one place to another, and the time it takes is a real pain in the neck. And also, it is impossible to transfer apps from Nokia C300 to BlackBerry because of different operating systems. Sometimes, not even all photos, videos and music files will be compatible. But, luckily, the BlackBerry developers have thought of a one way, which is simpler than the manual transfer mentioned above, to transfer your data from Nokia C300 to BlackBerry. It takes less time, but you still need to do some work.
