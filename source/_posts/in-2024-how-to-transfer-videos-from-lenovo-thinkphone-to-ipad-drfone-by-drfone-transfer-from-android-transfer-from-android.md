### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Lenovo ThinkPhone Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Lenovo ThinkPhone to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Lenovo ThinkPhone and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Lenovo ThinkPhone and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Lenovo ThinkPhone device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Lenovo ThinkPhone device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Lenovo ThinkPhone device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Lenovo ThinkPhone phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

![Lenovo ThinkPhone to iPhone transfer with ShareIt.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/transfer-data-from-motorola-to-iphone-1.jpg)

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Lenovo ThinkPhone to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Lenovo ThinkPhone to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones. You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Lenovo ThinkPhone phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code
- On your Lenovo ThinkPhone, a screen will appear to request a 6-10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Lenovo ThinkPhone device to make a secure connection between the two devices.

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.
