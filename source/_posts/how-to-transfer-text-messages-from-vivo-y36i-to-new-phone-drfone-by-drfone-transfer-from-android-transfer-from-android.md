**Media content**

The smartest way to Android migrate to new phone your media files (like photos, videos, music, etc.) is by syncing them with Google Drive. If your Drive has limited free space, then you need to manually transfer this data. Connect your device to your system and open its storage. From here, you can manually copy the files having your media content and paste them to a safe location (or directly to the new device’s storage).
