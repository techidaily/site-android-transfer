### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Vivo Y100i Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Vivo Y100i to iPhone transfer**.

On your Vivo Y100i device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
