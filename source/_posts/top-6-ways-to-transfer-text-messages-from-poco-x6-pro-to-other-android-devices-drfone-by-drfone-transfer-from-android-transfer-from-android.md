## Part 1: Is It Possible To Transfer Apps from Poco X6 Pro to Other Android Devices and iPhone to Android?

It is possible to transfer applications from an Android phone to another Android. There are multiple ways that Android offers to move apps between two smartphones. These include using the Google Play Store and signing in with the same Google account. Also, multiple tools and apps can assist you in this context.

By contrast, it is not feasible to **transfer apps to a new Android phone** from an iPhone. That's mainly because of the different operating software in the two devices. The applications downloaded in iOS are not compatible with Android. Additionally, Google Play Store does not support these iOS applications. That's why directly transferring apps from iPhone to Android is impossible. You must download it again from the Google Play Store on your Poco X6 Pro.
