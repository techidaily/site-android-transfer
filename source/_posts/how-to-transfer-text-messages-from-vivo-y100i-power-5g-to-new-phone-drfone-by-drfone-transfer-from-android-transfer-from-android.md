**Bookmarks and passwords**

If you use Google Chrome to store your passwords and bookmarks, then you can also migrate Android this content. Just go to Google Settings on the Vivo Y100i Power 5G device and turn on the option of “Smart Lock for Passwords”. In this way, you won’t have to enter your passwords over and over again.
