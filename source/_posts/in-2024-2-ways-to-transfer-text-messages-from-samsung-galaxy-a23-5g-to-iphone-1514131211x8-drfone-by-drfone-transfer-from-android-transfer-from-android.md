This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled.

2\. Go to settings app on your android device and click on “advanced settings”. Click on “security” and choose “Allow Hisuite to use HDB”. You will see the “Back Up” and “Restore” options. Click on “Back Up” and select the data you want to back up. You can encrypt your backup with a password. Then click on “Back Up”.

3\. Click on “Restore” to retrieve data from previous backups after selecting the backup file you want.
