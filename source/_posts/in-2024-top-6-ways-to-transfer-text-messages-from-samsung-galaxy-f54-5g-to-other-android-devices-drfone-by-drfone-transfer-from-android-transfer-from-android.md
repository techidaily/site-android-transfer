Alternatively, you can import contacts to iPhone XS/11 from Gmail from your Android mobile, as well. to do that, you need to get your Gmail and Android device contacts to get synced first.

**Here is the detailed guide to transferring contacts from an Android to an iOS device.**

1. Go to your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G and go to the ‘Accounts’ tab and enable syncing of contacts. ‘Settings’ > ‘Accounts’ > ‘Google’ > Turn on ‘Contacts’ switch > tap on ‘3 vertical dots’ > ‘Sync Now’.

1. Now, you need to add the same Gmail account to your iPhone X, in order to sync back contacts from it. For this, head to ‘Settings’ > ‘Passwords & Accounts’ > ‘Add Account’ > ‘Google’. Then, you’re required to punch in the details of the same Gmail account used over Android to sync contacts.

## How to transfer contacts from Samsung Galaxy F54 5G to iPhone XS/11 using SIM card

As you know the SIM card itself can hold a certain number of contacts, depending on the carrier and phone make and model.

2. Click on ‘Export to SIM’ or ‘SIM card’ and then select the source of contacts i.e. ‘Phone’/’WhatsApp’/’Google’/’Messenger’.
