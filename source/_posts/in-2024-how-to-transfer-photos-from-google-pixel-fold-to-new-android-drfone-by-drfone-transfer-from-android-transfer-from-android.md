## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Google Pixel Fold to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Google Pixel Fold to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Google Pixel Fold devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Google Pixel Fold, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Google Pixel Fold to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Google Pixel Fold to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Google Pixel Fold to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

![Transfer Photos from Google Pixel Fold to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg)

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Google Pixel Fold, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

![Transfer Photos from Google Pixel Fold to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg)

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Google Pixel Fold from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

5\. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

Wondershare Dr.Fone also features other helpful tools, such as the De-Duplicate option, which automatically scans all your contacts for any repetitions, which is always a nuisance (you often end up with duplicate contacts if you sync your contacts with Facebook, as well as already having them on your device, for example).

## Mobogenie Android USB File Transfer

**Advantages:**

- Uninstall stock apps in batches.
- Easy-to-use interface.
- Easily download and manage apps.
- Easily transfer multiple files from your PC to your Android, and vice versa.
- Free of charge.

**Disadvantages:**

- USB only.
- Only connect one Android device at a time.
- Does not have integrated music sharing.

**Overview:**

Download Mobogenie and run it, and connect your Google Pixel Fold to the computer. Once your device has been connected, you will be prompted to install the driver for your device so that the application is automatically downloaded onto it. Once you have completed this process, you will be taken to the home screen:

![bluetooth android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/moborobo-home.jpg)

As with other data management software, you can download and install apps onto your Google Pixel Fold from your PC. The advantage of this is that apps can be downloaded quickly, and also without costing you in terms of data roaming charges.

![usb android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/download-app-with-mobogenie.jpg)

A neat feature is the ability to uninstall apps that came preloaded on the phone as often we find ourselves with apps that we never use that we cannot delete.

![usb to android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/transfer-photos-with-mobogenie.jpg)

**Features:**

- Free.
- Support wireless connection of devices on the same network (although temperamental).
- Support multiple devices.
- Download apps onto it through app store.
- Simple to use.

**Overview:**

Download MoboRobo and install this Android USB file transfer tool on your computer. Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your Google Pixel Fold with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your Google Pixel Fold as well.

Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.

![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Google Pixel Fold with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
