### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Infinix Hot 40 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Infinix Hot 40 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Infinix Hot 40 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Infinix Hot 40 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Infinix Hot 40 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Infinix Hot 40 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Infinix Hot 40 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Infinix Hot 40 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Infinix Hot 40 to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Infinix Hot 40 to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones. You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Infinix Hot 40 phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

## Part 2. How To Make iPhone to Infinix Hot 40 Data Transfer Using Easy Software

Another contributing factor is the structure of the files. Android boasts a file system that is more straightforward, unlike iOS. As a solution, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone offers tools like Phone Transfer to simplify the process. With Dr. Fone's Phone Transfer, you can transfer any data from Infinix Hot 40 to iPhone or iPhone to Infinix Hot 40.



How to make **iPhone to Infinix Hot 40 data transfer** with Dr.Fone:

- **Step 1:** Open Dr.Fone’s Phone Transfer tool

Make a connection between your iPhone and your Infinix Hot 40 phone through USB cable on your computer. Launch [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) on your computer and navigate to Toolbox > Phone Transfer.
