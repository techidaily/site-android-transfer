Consider including dates, locations, or key details in the filenames to make your photos easily identifiable.

Move to iOS is an Android app developed to make it easier to transfer data from Xiaomi 13T Pro to iOS devices. It is available for free at Google Play Store and is of the minuscule size of approximately 2.2 MB.

The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from Xiaomi 13T Pro to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method. They can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) for the task.
