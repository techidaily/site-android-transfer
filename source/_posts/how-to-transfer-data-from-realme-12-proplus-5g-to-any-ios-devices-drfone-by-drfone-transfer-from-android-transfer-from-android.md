## Part 3: How to transfer music from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to your system.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).

## Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to iPad/iPhone

Transferring photos from your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it's essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won't make the same errors.

**1\. Insufficient battery levels**

Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad/iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.

**2\. Limited storage space**

Overlooking available storage space on the iPad/iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad/iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.

**3\. Interference from Third-Party Apps:**

Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.

**4\. Ignoring file compatibility:**

Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.

**5\. Skipping App Permissions:**

When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it's common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.
