**Camera:**

Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus have three cameras: a 12MP main camera and a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 64MP telephoto camera. The front camera comes in 10MP. On the other side, Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with a 108MP main camera, 12MP ultra-wide, and two 10MP telephoto cameras. Among these two telephoto cameras, one has 3x zoom capacity, and the other has 10X zoom capacity. S21 Ultra has a laser autofocus sensor that will track the subject and take the perfect shot. For video recording, three of these models have great video features. However, S21 Ultra is offering you the bright night sensor so you can record and take pictures in low light.

**Battery and Charging:**

Regarding the battery performance and charging system, there are many differences among Samsung Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra. Samsun Galaxy S21 has 4000 mAh battery capacity, Galaxy S21 Plus comes in 4800 mAh, and Galaxy S21 Ultra has 5000 mAh. So, comparatively, Galaxy S21 Ultra has the best quality battery. The charging system is the same for all of these three models. It needs 25W on a wired connection. You can also charge them wireless on 15W.

**Connectivity:**

In these three models, you will get 5G. So, there is no argument about this. However, Galaxy S21 Plus and S21 Ultra have been manufactured with Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) chips. It is a new feature that will provide hands-free control. Using these features, you can unlock your car or find the SmartTag tracker. Among these, S21 Ultra offers you more. It has Wi-Fi 6E compatibility, which is the fastest and lowest latency for Wi-Fi connection.

**Important Note:** New Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has new software to transfer all files to another device, called Smart switch. This feature is used for keeping the backup and restoring the files. Though it is good software, it has many cons. So, before using that app, check these cons.

- Smart Switch has a low-speed transfer problem. It shows up when you transfer data with wireless connectivity.
- After transferring the data, the smart switch does not back up the data. It is quite hard to recover the data using this app.
- Using the Smart Switch app, you can only transfer the data from Samsung to Samsung. You can't use it for other devices.
