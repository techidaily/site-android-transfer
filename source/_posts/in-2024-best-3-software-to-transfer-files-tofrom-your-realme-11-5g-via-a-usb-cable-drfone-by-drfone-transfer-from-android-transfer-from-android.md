As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Realme 11 5G with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

1. Then hit ‘Export’ and ‘Continue’ afterward.
2. Now, open the SIM card slot of your Realme 11 5G and unmount the SIM. Insert it on your iPhone XS/11 and turn it on. You can find the contacts on your iPhone.

**Note:** _Though, it’s rare nowadays. In case you happen to own a very old SIM card and your Realme 11 5G supported the size. You might need to cut it to fit the iPhone XS/11’s micro-SIM slot._
