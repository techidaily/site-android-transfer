- **Move to iOS could not communicate correctly with the Vivo V30 Lite 5G devices.**

To avoid this Move to iOS error, ensure both devices run on updated operating systems, i.e., android 4.0 or later and iOS 9 or later. The phones must have enough power, and lastly, ensure that you turn off background apps to avoid notifications during the transfer process.

- **Move to iOS stuck on preparing/transferring.**

You are transferring your android data to iOS, but the process is stuck on the transferring page. The problem is related to Wi-Fi connections.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 2: Clear all running apps

It is recommended to avoid using the android device o run applications when using the Move to iOS app. Since the app runs in the foreground, you should ensure all other apps in the android are disabled before starting the data transfer process. Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on

Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone's private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 4: Plug both devices to power

You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Vivo V30 Lite 5G devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode

When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.

The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.

### Tip 6: Check the storage requirement

Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don't need to transfer from your android device before getting started.

### Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer

Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.

### Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices

You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store. Generally, the app runs on Android 4.0 and above while transferring data to iOS 9.0 or later devices.

### Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization

Turning off the battery optimization on both your Android and iOS device is a requirement when using the Move to iOS tool. The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode. Therefore you should ensure the feature is closed from the settings of your android device.

In order to do so, you need:

**A registered PhoneCopy account.**

1\. On your computer, open any web browser of your choice and go to <https://www.phonecopy.com/en/>.

Note: Make sure your device is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the right section of the opened web page, click "REGISTER NOW."

3\. On the "REGISTRATION" page, populate the available fields with the correct values and click "CONTINUE" from the bottom.

4\. Follow the on-screen instructions thereafter to complete the account creation process.

Note: You may need to activate your account using the confirmation mail that you would receive while completing the account creation process.

**The PhoneCopy app on your Windows phone.**

1\. Power on your Vivo V30 Lite 5G smartphone.

Note: Make sure that the phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Store icon to open the Windows App Store.

Note: You must use your Microsoft account to sign in to Windows Store before the phone allows you to download the apps.

3\. Once you are on the "store" interface, search for and tap the "PhoneCopy" app

4\. On the next window that appears, tap "Install" pato install PhoneCopy on your Windows phone.

After you have successfully installed PhoneCopy on your Vivo V30 Lite 5G, it is now time to export all your contacts to the PhoneCopy server. You can do so by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Export data to the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. On your Windows phone, locate and tap to launch the "PhoneCopy" app.

2\. On the displayed interface, in the available fields provide your PhoneCopy account credentials (username and password) that you used to create your PhoneCopy account earlier.

3\. Once done, tap the"Export to phonecopy.com" button and wait till all your contacts are exported to the PhoneCopy server.

**Step 2: Import data to the iPhone from the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. Power on your iPhone.

Note: Make sure that your phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Apple App Store icon.

Note: Ensure that you are signed in to the App Store using your Apple ID.

3\. Search for, locate, download, and install the "PhoneCopy" app on your iPhone

4\. Once installed, tap the "PhoneCopy" icon on your iOS device to launch the program.

5\. When asked for, provide the same PhoneCopy credentials that you used to export the data from your Vivo V30 Lite 5G phone in the previous step.

6\. After you are signed in to your PhoneCopy account on your iPhone, click the "Synchronize" button to import all the data from the PhoneCopy server to your new iPhone.

Although PhoneCopy does a great job when it comes to transferring data between the phones from different platforms, the app comes with a few pros and cons which include:

Pros:

Registering and using PhoneCopy is free.

PhoneCopy can back up your calendar events, SMS, tasks, and notes and can help you import them on a different phone (typically on iPhone).

Cons:

Only up to 500 contacts, SMS, tasks, and notes can be synched while using the Basic version (free account) of PhoneCopy. To remove this restriction, you must buy the Premium version for which PhoneCopy charges $25 annually.

The archived data is auto-deleted from the PhoneCopy server after one month when using the Basic version, and after 1 year when using the Premium version.
