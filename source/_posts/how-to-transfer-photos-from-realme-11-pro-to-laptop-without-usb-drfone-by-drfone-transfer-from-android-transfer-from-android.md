Tagging your photos is a versatile way to categorize and organize them based on themes, events, or people. Most photo management applications allow you to add descriptive tags that make it easy to search the media files later. This is particularly useful for quickly locating pictures of specific occasions or individuals.

### Keep Your Photos in Separate Folders

Make it a habit to create separate folders for different events, locations, or time periods. This organization method helps you maintain a clear structure for your photo collection. For example, you might have folders for vacations, family gatherings, or special occasions. Organizing photos this way simplifies navigation and ensures that each set of pictures is kept properly.

### Rename Your Photo

Give your photos descriptive and unique filenames that reflect either their content or context. Organizing your files by their respective labels helps you find them easily instead of relying solely on visual cues. Consider including dates, locations, or key details in the filenames to make your photos easily identifiable.

**NOTE:** By incorporating these organization techniques, you can surely enjoy your memory collection on the larger canvas of your computer screen. Take advantage of these methods to transform your digital photo library into a well-ordered and easily accessible archive. Moreover, these are prerequisites for the tutorials on how to transfer photos from your phone to your laptop without USB.

A neat feature is the ability to uninstall apps that came preloaded on the phone as often we find ourselves with apps that we never use that we cannot delete.

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Realme 11 Pro with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Old Android to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme 11 Pro devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

- On your Realme 11 Pro, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

- This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

- Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

![Transfer Photos from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg)

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also, both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm the completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

Now, we’ll discuss how to transfer contacts from one Android to another with the help of a SIM card.

## Part 2: How to transfer contacts from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices using SIM card?

## Part 3: How to transfer contacts from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct?

To transfer contacts from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct is one of the easiest methods. For this method, make sure that you should enable “Bluetooth” or “Wi-Fi Direct” on both the Android devices.

The steps:
