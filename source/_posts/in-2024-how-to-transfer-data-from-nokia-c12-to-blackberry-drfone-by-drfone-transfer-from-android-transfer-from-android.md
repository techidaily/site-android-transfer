You must be familiar with Nokia C12 Migrate if you are a Nokia C12 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Nokia C12 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Nokia C12 device to others, such as iPhones.

In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Nokia C12 to iPhone besides Nokia C12 Migrate.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

On your Nokia C12 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

Step 7: After transferring is complete, finish the iPhone device setup process.

The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from Nokia C12 to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method. They can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) for the task.
