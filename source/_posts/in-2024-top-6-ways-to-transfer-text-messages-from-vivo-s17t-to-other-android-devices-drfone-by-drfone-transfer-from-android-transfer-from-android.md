## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Vivo S17t to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Vivo S17t Migrate if you are a Vivo S17t user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Vivo S17t devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Vivo S17t device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Vivo S17t models are now unable to run Vivo S17t Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

On your Vivo S17t device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
