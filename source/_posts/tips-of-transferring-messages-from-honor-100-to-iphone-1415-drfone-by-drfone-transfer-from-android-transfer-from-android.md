## Tips of Transferring Messages from Honor 100 to iPhone 14/15

Are you switching your phone to the latest iPhone 14 or 15 and wondering how to transfer your important text messages from your Honor 100? Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.

Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.

This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to **transfer texts from Honor 100 to iPhone**. Let's explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.



When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Honor 100 to iPhone, Apple's official app, "Move to iOS," can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.

To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Honor 100. Then, follow the steps to **transfer SMS from Honor 100 to iPhone** here:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the "Apps & Data" screen. At this point, select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."
- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Honor 100. Then, review and tap "Agree" to Terms and Conditions to proceed.
- **Step 3:** Enter the Code. On your Honor 100, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Honor 100 to make a secure connection between the two devices.
- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer. With the Honor 100 devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select "Text Messages" and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process.

## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Honor 100 to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Honor 100 before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Honor 100, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Honor 100’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.
- **Step 3:** Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you'll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.
- **Step 4:** Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.
