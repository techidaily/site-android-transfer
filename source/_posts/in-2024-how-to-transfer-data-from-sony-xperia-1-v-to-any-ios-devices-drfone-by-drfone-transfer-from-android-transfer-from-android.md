Make sure that you have an active Internet connection, and that background data is switched off. The importance of checking your Internet connection before proceeding to more extreme measures for all issues cannot be ignored. The issues that may be disturbing you might be due to an issue with your device's connection to the Internet

1. Switch Off and Switch On your Data Connection.

### Step 1. Connect Android phone with a computer and run Dr.Fone

To start with, connect your Sony Xperia 1 V with a computer either via a USB cable. Run Dr.Fone on your computer and choose Transfer fron the main window Then, your Sony Xperia 1 V will be detected instantly. After that, the primary window will appears like the screenshot shows below.

### Step 2. Android to Outlook sync

Then, click "Contacts" under "Information" panel on the top. In the contact management window, choose the contacts that you want to export. Click "Export" button. When the drop-down menu pops up, you can either click "Export selected contacts to computer" or "Export all contacts to computer". After that, click "to Outlook Express" or "to Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013". Then, the contract transferring begins. Be sure your Sony Xperia 1 V is connected all the time.

As you see, apart from exporting Android contacts to Outlook, you can also copy contacts from Sony Xperia 1 V to vCard, Windows Live Mail and Windows Address Book. If you have a Gmail account, you’re able to export Android contacts to your computer, and then backup these Android contacts to your Gmail account too.
