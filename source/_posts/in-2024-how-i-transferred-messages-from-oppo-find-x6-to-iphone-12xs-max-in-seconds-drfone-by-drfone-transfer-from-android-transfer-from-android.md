## Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Oppo Find X6 to iPad/iPhone

Transferring photos from your Oppo Find X6 to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it's essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won't make the same errors.

**1\. Insufficient battery levels**

Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad/iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.

**2\. Limited storage space**

Overlooking available storage space on the iPad/iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad/iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.

**3\. Interference from Third-Party Apps:**

Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.

**4\. Ignoring file compatibility:**

Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.

**5\. Skipping App Permissions:**

When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it's common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.

## Part 2: Transfer Files from Oppo Find X6 to Other Android Devices by Nearby Share

Nearby Share is a method developed by Google to ****share files between Android phones****. It can be considered Google’s answer to Apple’s AirDrop, though, unlike AirDrop, it doesn’t require Wi-Fi. This method is available for all Android devices though you should use the latest Android OS for smoother working. Moreover, Bluetooth needs to be enabled to use this method.

### Step-by-Step Guide To Transfer Files via Nearby Share

****Step 1:**** You will need to activate “Nearby Share” on both devices first. To do that, go to the phone’s “Settings” and access the “Google” settings. Here, tap “Devices and Sharing,” and from the next appearing screen, choose “Nearby Share.”

![choose the nearby share option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/transfer-files-from-android-to-android-4.jpg)

****Step 2:**** In the “Nearby Share” screen, toggle it on and set device visibility to “Everyone.” Once you activate it on both Android devices, find and select the files you want to transfer on the old Android phone.

![enable the nearby share option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/transfer-files-from-android-to-android-5.jpg)

It will detect nearby devices and select your new Android device once it appears. A prompt will appear on both phones with a matching PIN. Accept the files on the new phone to start the transfer process.
