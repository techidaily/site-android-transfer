## How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly

Since Google Pixel Fold is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Google Pixel Fold, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Google Pixel Fold to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Google Pixel Fold to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Google Pixel Fold Migrate if you are a Google Pixel Fold user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Google Pixel Fold devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Google Pixel Fold device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Google Pixel Fold models are now unable to run Google Pixel Fold Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Google Pixel Fold to iPhone besides Google Pixel Fold Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Google Pixel Fold Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Google Pixel Fold to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Google Pixel Fold and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Google Pixel Fold and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Google Pixel Fold device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Google Pixel Fold device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Google Pixel Fold device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Google Pixel Fold phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.
