However, most of the latest Oppo K11 5G models are now unable to run Oppo K11 5G Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015.

In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Oppo K11 5G to iPhone besides Oppo K11 5G Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Oppo K11 5G and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Oppo K11 5G and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

On your Oppo K11 5G device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
