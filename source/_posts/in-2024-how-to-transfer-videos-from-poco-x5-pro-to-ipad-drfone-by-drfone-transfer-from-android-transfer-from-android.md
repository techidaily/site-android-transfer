## Transfer Files to Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro via PC

Using a computer as an intermediary device for transferring files is another excellent idea, and it’ll even let you organize your old phone’s data before you copy it to your new device. You’ll need to follow these steps to transfer data from your old phone to your PC and from your PC to your new Pixel 8/8 Pro device:

1. Connect your old Samsung device to your PC via USB.
2. Tap the phone’s notification and select **File Transfer**under the “Use USB for” option.
3. Access its memory through the computer’s File Explorer.
4. Select the files and folders you want to copy and transfer them to a new folder on your PC. You can then go through these files on your PC, delete what you don’t need, and organize everything before transferring the data to your new Pixel 8 device, but this is optional.

    ![copy data to the pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-14.jpg)

5. Disconnect the old phone from the computer.
6. Connect your new Pixel phone to the PC.
7. Once again, click the phone’s notification and select the **File Transfer**
8. Transfer the contents of your computer’s folder onto the new device.
9. Disconnect the new device after your files have been copied.

You’ll need to consider which types of files go into which folders. For example, you’ll need to ensure that music data goes into Android’s Music folder, pictures and videos go into Camera or DCIM folders, and documents and downloads have their respective folders, which are typical on Android.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
7. Choose the latest backup made on your Samsung phone and tap **Restore**to copy data from Samsung to Pixel.

It’s worth noting that Google Drive users aren’t limited to 15 GB of storage space, as paid plans also include 100 GB and 200 GB options for a few dollars per month, making this type of transfer incredibly efficient.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.
