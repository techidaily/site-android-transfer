## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.
