### Keep Your Photos in Separate Folders

Make it a habit to create separate folders for different events, locations, or time periods. This organization method helps you maintain a clear structure for your photo collection. For example, you might have folders for vacations, family gatherings, or special occasions. Organizing photos this way simplifies navigation and ensures that each set of pictures is kept properly.

### Rename Your Photo

Give your photos descriptive and unique filenames that reflect either their content or context. Organizing your files by their respective labels helps you find them easily instead of relying solely on visual cues. Consider including dates, locations, or key details in the filenames to make your photos easily identifiable.

**NOTE:** By incorporating these organization techniques, you can surely enjoy your memory collection on the larger canvas of your computer screen. Take advantage of these methods to transform your digital photo library into a well-ordered and easily accessible archive. Moreover, these are prerequisites for the tutorials on how to transfer photos from your phone to your laptop without USB.
