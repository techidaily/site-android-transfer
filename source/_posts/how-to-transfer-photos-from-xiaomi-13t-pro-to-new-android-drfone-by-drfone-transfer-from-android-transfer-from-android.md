## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Xiaomi 13T Pro to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Xiaomi 13T Pro to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Xiaomi 13T Pro devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Xiaomi 13T Pro, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Xiaomi 13T Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Xiaomi 13T Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Xiaomi 13T Pro to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Xiaomi 13T Pro, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

Nevertheless, you will need to find a solution to these problems to transfer your data successfully from android to iOS devices. This section will discuss possible solutions to the errors that occasionally appear when moving android data to iOS devices.

### Tip 1: Restart both your devices

Restarting your devices is the essential thing to do when troubleshooting the Move to iOS problems. It is a great way o eliminate minor issues during data transfer from android to iOS devices. The process can resolve the Move to iOS stuck on connecting to iPhone issues. A simple restart will eliminate the bugs and any cached error in the Xiaomi 13T Pro devices.

### Tip 2: Clear all running apps

It is recommended to avoid using the android device o run applications when using the Move to iOS app. Since the app runs in the foreground, you should ensure all other apps in the android are disabled before starting the data transfer process. Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.

### Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on

Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone's private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.

### Tip 4: Plug both devices to power

You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Xiaomi 13T Pro devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.

### Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode

When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.

The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.

### Tip 6: Check the storage requirement

Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don't need to transfer from your android device before getting started.

### Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer

Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.

### Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices

You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store. Generally, the app runs on Android 4.0 and above while transferring data to iOS 9.0 or later devices.

### Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization

Turning off the battery optimization on both your Android and iOS device is a requirement when using the Move to iOS tool. The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode. Therefore you should ensure the feature is closed from the settings of your android device.

### Method 3: Google Drive \[Cloud Storages\]

Cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive provide a practical and effective method. This process enables effortless video transfer between an Android device and an iPad. Google Drive functions as a hub for storing, sharing, and accessing files among diverse internet-connected devices.

- **Step 1.** First, download and install the Google Drive app on your Android and sign in using your Google account. Tap the "+ New" button, select "Upload" within the app, and pick the videos you want from your device's storage.
