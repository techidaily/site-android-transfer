## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Vivo Y100A to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Vivo Y100A to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Vivo Y100A devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Vivo Y100A, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Vivo Y100A to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

### Step 2. Connect your old and new phones to the computer

As I mentioned above, Dr.Fone lets you export SMS on the old Nokia phone, Android phone and even iPhone, and then copy them to your new iPhone or Android phone. So, connect two phones to do the SMS transfer to the computer with USB cables.

Besides, "Flip" between two phones lets you change places of the two phones.
