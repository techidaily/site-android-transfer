## Part 4: Sync Files from Honor X50 to Other Android Devices With Google Account

Google Account is another great way for ****Android-to-Android file transfer**** if you haven’t set up the new phone yet. It allows you to back up all your data on the old device and restore it to the new Android device. With this method, you can transfer most of the data from the old phone, including settings, contacts, notes, etc.

### Step-by-Step Guide To Transfer Files With Google Account

****Step 1:**** On your old Android device, go to “Settings” and tap “Google.” In the Google settings, select “Backup” and tap “Backup Now” to back up your phone. Once the backup is complete, move to the new device.
