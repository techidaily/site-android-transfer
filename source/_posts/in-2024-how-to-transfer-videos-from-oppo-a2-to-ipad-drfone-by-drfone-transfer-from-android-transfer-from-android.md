## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Oppo A2 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Oppo A2 Migrate if you are a Oppo A2 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Oppo A2 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Oppo A2 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Oppo A2 models are now unable to run Oppo A2 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Oppo A2 to iPhone besides Oppo A2 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Oppo A2 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Oppo A2 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Oppo A2 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Oppo A2 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Oppo A2 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Oppo A2 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Oppo A2 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Oppo A2 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.
