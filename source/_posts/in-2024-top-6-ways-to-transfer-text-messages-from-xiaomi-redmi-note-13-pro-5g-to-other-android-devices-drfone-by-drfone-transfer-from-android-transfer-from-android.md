Note: Ensure that you are signed in to the App Store using your Apple ID.

3\. Search for, locate, download, and install the "PhoneCopy" app on your iPhone

4\. Once installed, tap the "PhoneCopy" icon on your iOS device to launch the program.

5\. When asked for, provide the same PhoneCopy credentials that you used to export the data from your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G phone in the previous step.

6\. After you are signed in to your PhoneCopy account on your iPhone, click the "Synchronize" button to import all the data from the PhoneCopy server to your new iPhone.

Although PhoneCopy does a great job when it comes to transferring data between the phones from different platforms, the app comes with a few pros and cons which include:

Pros:

Registering and using PhoneCopy is free.

PhoneCopy can back up your calendar events, SMS, tasks, and notes and can help you import them on a different phone (typically on iPhone).

Cons:

Only up to 500 contacts, SMS, tasks, and notes can be synched while using the Basic version (free account) of PhoneCopy. To remove this restriction, you must buy the Premium version for which PhoneCopy charges $25 annually.

The archived data is auto-deleted from the PhoneCopy server after one month when using the Basic version, and after 1 year when using the Premium version.

![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
