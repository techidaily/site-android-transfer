Since it is a complete Android phone manager, you can use it to transfer all the other kinds of data (like photos, videos, contacts, messages, and more) from one source to another. Unlike Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer that moves all the music files at once, you can perform a selective data transfer. The interface will provide a preview of your data so that you can choose the files you wish to move. To learn how to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

5. Wait a moment and let the application automatically transfer your selected music files from your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to your iPhone.

    Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to iTunes as well. To do this, you need to select the “Transfer Device Media to iTunes” option from its home page.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to your system. Though, to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).

## Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to iPhone?

These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them. The good thing about these streaming services is that you can access your music from multiple devices. For instance, let’s consider the example of Spotify.

Once you have created a playlist on your Spotify account, you can access it from any other device. You can even access your music by visiting its website because it will be stored on Spotify’s server and not your device itself.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-transfer streaming music](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-4.jpg)

If you are moving from an Android to an iPhone, you can follow these steps to ensure your Spotify music won’t be lost.

- Launch Spotify on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition and go to the Playlist tab. From here, you can create a playlist. Later, you can add your favorite songs to this playlist as well. You can even create multiple playlists on the app.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-create a playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-5.jpg)

- Afterward, unlock your iPhone and go to the App store. Look for the music streaming app and download it on your phone.
- Once you log in to your Spotify account using your credentials, you can access “My Music” and access all your saved playlists.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-access all your saved playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg)

The same drill can be followed for all the other streaming services as well. While you can sync your music using these streaming services, the songs you have made available offline will not be listed here. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have saved them in a playlist beforehand.
