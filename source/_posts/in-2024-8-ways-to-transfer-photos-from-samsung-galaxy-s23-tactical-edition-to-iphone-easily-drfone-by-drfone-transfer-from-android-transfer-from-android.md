    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-select your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition as a source device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-files-quickly-to-android-1.png)

3. To manage the music files stored on the Android device, go to the “Music” tab on the interface. Here, you can view all music files, podcasts, audiobooks, songs, etc., listed in different categories.
4. Choose the files and then select the export button on the toolbar. From here, select the connected iPhone as a source.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on the export icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/android-transfer-export-music-01.jpg)

5. Wait a moment and let the application automatically transfer your selected music files from your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to your iPhone.

    Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to iTunes as well.

This will launch a pop-up window and let you move your music files from the Android device to iTunes directly.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).

Alternatively, you can also go to its options and click on “Add files to Library”. In this way, you can manually add new music to your iTunes library.

## Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to iPhone?

These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-create a playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-5.jpg)

- Afterward, unlock your iPhone and go to the App store. Look for the music streaming app and download it on your phone.
- Once you log in to your Spotify account using your credentials, you can access “My Music” and access all your saved playlists.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-access all your saved playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg)
