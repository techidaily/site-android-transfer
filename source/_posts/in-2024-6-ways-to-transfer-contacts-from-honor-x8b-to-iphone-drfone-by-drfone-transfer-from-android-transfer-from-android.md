Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Honor X8b and copy or move the desired videos from your Honor X8b to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Honor X8b.
