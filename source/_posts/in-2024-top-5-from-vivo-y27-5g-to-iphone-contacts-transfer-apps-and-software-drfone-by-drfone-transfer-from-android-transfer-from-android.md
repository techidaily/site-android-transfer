## Part 4: Clone Android phone using Phone Clone

Huawei has also developed a dedicated app – Phone Clone to transfer the data from one Android device to another wirelessly. In this way, you don’t have to set up multiple accounts Android for every phone you buy. The app supports a fast and extensive cloning option with a user-friendly interface. To make your new device an Android clone, follow these steps:

1\. Launch the Phone Clone app on both devices. If you don’t have the app, you can download it from Google Play.

Download Phone Clone: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hicloud.android.clone&hl=en>

2\. After launching the app on the new phone, mark it as a receiver. This will turn your phone into a Wi-Fi hotspot.

## Part 5: Clone Android phone using Google Drive

Google Drive is ideally used to store data on the cloud. However, it can also be used to back up and restore your data. Even though Google Drive transfers the data wirelessly, it consumes a substantial amount of data usage. Also, the process is not as fast or smooth as other options. Nevertheless, you can learn how to clone Android phone using Google Drive by following these steps:

1\. Unlock your source Android device and go to Settings > Backup & Reset. From here, you can turn on the option to backup your data.

2\. Furthermore, you can verify the account on which you are taking the backup of your data and turn on the option of “Automatic Restore”.  This will be of great help if you are managing multiple accounts Android.

![backup android with google drive](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15115452026138.jpg)

3\. After taking a complete backup of your data, turn on your brand-new Android to perform its setup.

4\. Log in using the credentials of your Google Account. Make sure that the account should be linked to your previous device.

![log in google account on target phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15115452302774.jpg)

5\. After signing in, the Vivo Y27 5G device will automatically sync to the account and identify the backup files. Simply select the most recent backup file.

6\. Also, you can select the apps and app data that you wish to transfer. Click on the “Restore” button at the end to make your target device an Android clone of your previous phone.

## Part 6: Clone Vivo Y27 5G Phone Using Bluetooth

Using Bluetooth for cloning an Android phone is not the most efficient method. It is more suitable for transferring specific files than creating a comprehensive clone. Moreover, it's a slow and manual process that requires you to select and transfer files one by one. Here's how you can use Bluetooth for this purpose:

1\. On both Android devices, turn on Bluetooth and pair the Vivo Y27 5G devices. Navigate to the file you want to send on the source device, tap "Share," and select "Bluetooth."

2\. Now, choose the targeted device to send the file. Move to the other device and "Accept" the incoming file transfer.
