## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

How to transfer music from iPod to Android:

**Step 1:** Open Dr.Fone’s Phone Transfer tool

Make a connection between your iPod and your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G on your computer. Launch [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) on your computer and navigate to Toolbox > Phone Transfer.

**Step 2:** Specify the source and destination devices

After connecting them, the platform will identify the connected devices and load their data. Choose the Source and Destination devices to set the transfer path. Use the Flip button to alter the transfer direction (for example, when you want to transfer from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G to iPod instead).

**Step 3:** Choose the music category for the transfer

Proceed to select the types of data you wish to transfer. Checkmark music and click the Start Transfer button. If you want to remove existing data from the destination device, you can select “Clear data before copy.”

## Conclusion

Transferring music seamlessly between iPod and Android devices, and vice versa, has become more accessible than ever with the right tools and methods. Bluetooth technology serves as a wireless bridge, allowing users to effortlessly move their favourite music from an iPod to an Android device.

On the other hand, there are also apps like Move to iOS and [Dr.Fone Basic](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) that facilitate the transfer of music depending on your needs. These options empower users to break through the traditional barriers of device exclusivity and seamlessly enjoy their music collections across different ecosystems.
