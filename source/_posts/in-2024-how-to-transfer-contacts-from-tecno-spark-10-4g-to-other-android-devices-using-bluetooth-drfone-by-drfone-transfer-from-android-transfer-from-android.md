If you are going to be upgrading your old Android to one of the fancy new Android smartphones soon, you are in the right place. You will learn how to transfer contacts from the old device to the new one easily and smoothly.

## Part I: How to Transfer Contacts from Tecno Spark 10 4G to Other Android Devices via Bluetooth?

This method works if you are not trading in your old smartphone to offset the cost of the new, as to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth you will require both devices present and in close proximity, a few feet away at best. There are advantages to transferring contacts using Bluetooth, such as no need for using the internet, going through any other hoops, or opening special apps! Everything you need to share contacts from one Android phone to another is built right into your phone! Now, to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, you must first pair the two devices together so as to allow for seamless contacts transfer.

### I.I: Pairing Two Android Devices Together

Here’s how to pair your old and new phone together via Bluetooth:

Step 1: On your old and new devices, go to Settings, then Bluetooth

Step 2: Make sure Bluetooth is “On” on both of them

Step 3: If everything is done correctly, both devices will show themselves to each other

![enable bluetooth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-1.jpg)

Step 4: Tap the other device on either of them. Here, the Moto G4 Play was tapped on OnePlus Nord 2:

![initiate pairing process on either device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-2.jpg)

Step 5: A prompt to pair with the new phone will come on the other device as well. For your device, make sure that the PIN is the same on both devices to ensure the security of the connection. This PIN is generated afresh and is unique, so the PIN in the image is not the PIN you will see on your devices. Tap Pair on your old device to pair the two devices together using Bluetooth.

Step 6: After pairing is complete, both devices will show under paired devices on each other:

![old device showing paired android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-3.jpg)

And that’s how simple it is to pair devices to each other using Bluetooth!

### I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth

Here is how to transfer contacts from one Android to another, easily, using Bluetooth:

Step 1: Go to Phone on your old phone and select the Contacts tab

Step 2: Tap the vertical ellipses and select Import/ Export.

![export contacts from old android to new](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-4.jpg)

This particular option can vary by your phone model and Android flavor, this is on Android 7 running on Motorola G4 Play. If you are unable to find a way to select contacts or share contacts in the Phone app on your phone, use the Contacts app on your phone for the same effect.

Step 3: A popup will emerge:

![select share all contacts to transfer contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-5.jpg)

Select Share All Contacts.

Step 4: When you do that, this will come up:

![select bluetooth as the method to share with](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-6.jpg)

Select Bluetooth in the Share With menu. You may select Always or Just Once and proceed.

Step 5: Choose the paired handset, in this case, the OnePlus Nord 2:

![select paired device to transfer to](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-7.jpg)

Step 6: The VCF file will be exported to Nord 2 and you can accept it on the Nord 2 (new device).

![receive contacts on new device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-8.jpg)

And that is how to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth!

## Part II: Other Methods to Transfer Contacts from Tecno Spark 10 4G to Other Android Devices

What are other ways to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another? Glad you asked. Because there are other ways to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another that do not use Bluetooth and can be both seamless and more powerful than the Bluetooth method, depending on your tastes and needs.

### II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account

This is another method to transfer your contacts on one Android device and restore them on another Android device. Here’s how to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Google Sync:

Step 1: Go to Settings on your old device

Step 2: Tap Accounts

Step 3: Tap the account you want to transfer contacts from

Step 4: Make sure that there is a checkmark next to Contacts, or, in other words, Contacts sync is enabled/ toggled.

![enable contacts sync in google account settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-9.jpg)

Now, Google will sync your contacts from the Tecno Spark 10 4G device onto the cloud, and your new device signed into the same Google Account will automatically download the contacts.

### II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps

Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Tecno Spark 10 4G to iOS.

There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.

Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device

Step 2: Keep the Tecno Spark 10 4G devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Tecno Spark 10 4G devices are in different rooms or too far away.

Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Tecno Spark 10 4G devices

Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android

Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device

Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices

Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.

Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.

Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.

That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.

**Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods**

It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.

In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Tecno Spark 10 4G devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.

## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Tecno Spark 10 4G to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Tecno Spark 10 4G before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Tecno Spark 10 4G, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Tecno Spark 10 4G’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.
- **Step 3:** Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you'll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.
- **Step 4:** Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.
