Now, to answer **how to transfer photos from Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iPhone**, there is another simple solution that you can make use of. It is called the “Move to iOS app,” which you can download freely from the Google Play store.

- **Step 1:** On your iPhone, go to a screen called ‘Apps & Data’ > choose the ‘Move Data from Android’ option.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-app and data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg) ![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move data from android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-7.jpg)

The next step is to take your Vivo T2 Pro 5G to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.

- **Step 2:** Switch to your Vivo T2 Pro 5G, open the Google Play Store, and search for the ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- **Step 3:** Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move from android to ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-8.jpg)
