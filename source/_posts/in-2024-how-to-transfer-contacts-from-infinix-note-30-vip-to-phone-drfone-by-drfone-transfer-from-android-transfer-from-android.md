## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 VIP to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 VIP to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Infinix Note 30 VIP devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Infinix Note 30 VIP, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 VIP to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

When it is completed, the data would have been transferred from your old android to the new android.

**Huawei Backup**

Huawei devices have HiSuite, an inbuilt manager tool. This app helps users to manage the data on their Huawei devices and also to back up and restore data. To backup and restore on Huawei devices using Hisuite, follow the steps below

1\. Download the tool [here](http://consumer.huawei.com/minisite/HiSuite_en/) and install. This tool is supported by windows only. Then, open the tool and connect your Huawei device to you PC by means of a USB cable.

2\. Go to settings app on your android device and click on “advanced settings”. Click on “security” and choose “Allow Hisuite to use HDB”. You will see the “Back Up” and “Restore” options. Click on “Back Up” and select the data you want to back up. You can encrypt your backup with a password. Then click on “Back Up”.

3\. Click on “Restore” to retrieve data from previous backups after selecting the backup file you want.
