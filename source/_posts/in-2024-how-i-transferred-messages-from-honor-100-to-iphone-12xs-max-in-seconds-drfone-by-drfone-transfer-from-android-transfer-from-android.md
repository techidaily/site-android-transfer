- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Honor 100 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Honor 100 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.
