**Note:** To transfer data to or from iPhone (iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X supported), iPad and iPod, you should install iTunes on the computer.

### Step 2. Connect your old and new phones to the computer

As I mentioned above, Dr.Fone lets you export SMS on the old Nokia phone, Android phone and even iPhone, and then copy them to your new iPhone or Android phone. So, connect two phones to do the SMS transfer to the computer with USB cables.
