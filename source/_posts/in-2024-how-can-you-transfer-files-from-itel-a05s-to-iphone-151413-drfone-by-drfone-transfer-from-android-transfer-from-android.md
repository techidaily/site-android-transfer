## How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly

Since Itel A05s is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Itel A05s, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Itel A05s to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Itel A05s to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Itel A05s Migrate if you are a Itel A05s user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Itel A05s devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Itel A05s device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Itel A05s models are now unable to run Itel A05s Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Itel A05s to iPhone besides Itel A05s Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Itel A05s Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Itel A05s to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Itel A05s and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Itel A05s and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Itel A05s device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Itel A05s device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Itel A05s device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Itel A05s phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Itel A05s to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Itel A05s to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones.

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.
