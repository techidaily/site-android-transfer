Step 7: After transferring is complete, finish the iPhone device setup process.

The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from Motorola Edge 40 Pro to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method. They can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) for the task.
