## Can I Transfer iPod Music to Android?

**Can you transfer music from an iPod to an Android phone**? Despite the fact that the iPod is an Apple product, transferring its music to an Android device is indeed possible.

One of the most straightforward ways to transfer music from your iPod to an Android device is by using Bluetooth.
