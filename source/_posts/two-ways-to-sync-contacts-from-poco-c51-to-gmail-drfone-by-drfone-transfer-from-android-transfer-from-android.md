## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Poco C51 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Poco C51 Migrate if you are a Poco C51 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Poco C51 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Poco C51 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Poco C51 models are now unable to run Poco C51 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Poco C51 to iPhone besides Poco C51 Migrate.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Poco C51 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Poco C51 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Poco C51 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Poco C51 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.
