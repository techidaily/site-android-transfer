**Bookmarks and passwords**

If you use Google Chrome to store your passwords and bookmarks, then you can also migrate Android this content. Just go to Google Settings on the Oppo A78 5G device and turn on the option of “Smart Lock for Passwords”. In this way, you won’t have to enter your passwords over and over again.

As you can see, the manual phone migration method will consume a lot of time and effort of yours. Therefore, we recommend using Dr.Fone Switch to migrate Android to Android without any data loss. It is a highly secure and reliable tool that will let you migrate Android to any other platform without any hassle.
