## Part 3. How to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 5G to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?

Bluetooth transfer is one of the oldest methods that can be used to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 5G to Other Android Devices, and it is a simple way to make use of it.

**Here are the steps to follow to know how to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 5G to Other Android Devices.**

**Step 1.** There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your OnePlus Nord N30 5G

**Method 1:** The first method is to swipe from top to down on your OnePlus Nord N30 5G to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.

**Method 2:** Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your OnePlus Nord N30 5G, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on.

![transfer music from android to android-Go to “Connection”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-8.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.

Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.
