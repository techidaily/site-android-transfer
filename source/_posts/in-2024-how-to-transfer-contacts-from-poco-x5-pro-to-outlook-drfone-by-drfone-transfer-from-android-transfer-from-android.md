When Poco X5 Pro Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Poco X5 Pro to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Poco X5 Pro and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Poco X5 Pro device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

For more details, follow the instructions below:
