![Transfer Photos from Infinix Smart 7 HD to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Infinix Smart 7 HD devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Infinix Smart 7 HD, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Smart 7 HD to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Infinix Smart 7 HD to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Infinix Smart 7 HD to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Infinix Smart 7 HD, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

- **Step 1: Open Dr.Fone and Connect iPad and Android**

Connect your Android and iPad to the computer and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone. Click "Toolbox" from the left side panel and choose "Phone Transfer." It will lead to the Phone Transfer window with Wondershare Dr.Fone recognizing both of your devices.

- **Step 2: Define Source and Destination Positions**

Here, ensure that the Android device is on "Source" while the iPad is on the "Destination" position. Use the "Flip" switch if the positions are wrong. Now, choose the videos and other data you want to transfer and hit "Start Transfer." This will kickstart the transfer process of videos between devices.

### Method 2: iTunes

Using iTunes to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad involves a slightly indirect process. The variance in operating systems is the primary reason for this distinction. iTunes is primarily tailored for iOS devices; however, with supplemental steps, it can be utilized to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad. Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Infinix Smart 7 HD and copy or move the desired videos from your Infinix Smart 7 HD to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Infinix Smart 7 HD.

- **Step 2.** Access the "File" menu and choose either "Add File to Library" or "Add Folder to Library." Proceed by locating and selecting the transferred videos to import them into your iTunes library.

- **Step 3.** Connect your computer to the iPad using a USB cable to enable iTunes recognition of your iPad. Click on the iPad icon positioned at the top-left corner of iTunes. Next, navigate to the "Movies" tab located in the left sidebar to continue the process.

- **Step 4.** Select the "Sync Movies" option by checking the corresponding box and pick out the specific videos you wish to move to your iPad. Afterward, proceed by clicking the "Apply" button to commence the transfer process of the chosen videos from iTunes to your iPad.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are various methods to transfer videos from Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPad that offer distinct advantages. Wireless options like Google Drive and email are convenient. At the same time, wired methods such as using iTunes and the many capabilities of Wondershare Dr.Fone stand out. For comprehensive transfers, Dr.Fone emerges as a reliable solution. It offers versatile tools like Phone Manager and Phone Transfer, and its robust functionalities make it a recommended choice.
