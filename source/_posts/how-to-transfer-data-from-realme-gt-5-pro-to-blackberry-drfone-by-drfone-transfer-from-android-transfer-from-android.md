### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Realme GT 5 Pro Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Realme GT 5 Pro to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Realme GT 5 Pro and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Realme GT 5 Pro and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Realme GT 5 Pro device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Realme GT 5 Pro device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Realme GT 5 Pro device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Realme GT 5 Pro phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Realme GT 5 Pro to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Realme GT 5 Pro to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones. You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Realme GT 5 Pro phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code
- On your Realme GT 5 Pro, a screen will appear to request a 6-10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Realme GT 5 Pro device to make a secure connection between the two devices.

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

- **Step 5:** Transfer complete.
- Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process.
