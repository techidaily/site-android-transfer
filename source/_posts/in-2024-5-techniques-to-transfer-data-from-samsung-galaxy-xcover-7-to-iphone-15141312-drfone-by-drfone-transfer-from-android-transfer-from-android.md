<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure.

There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 to iPhone 15 conveniently.

It is possible to transfer applications from an Android phone to another Android. There are multiple ways that Android offers to move apps between two smartphones.
