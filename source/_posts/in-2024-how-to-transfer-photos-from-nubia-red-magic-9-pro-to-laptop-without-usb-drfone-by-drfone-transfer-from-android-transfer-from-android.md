## Transfer Files to Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro via PC

Using a computer as an intermediary device for transferring files is another excellent idea, and it’ll even let you organize your old phone’s data before you copy it to your new device. You’ll need to follow these steps to transfer data from your old phone to your PC and from your PC to your new Pixel 8/8 Pro device:

1. Connect your old Samsung device to your PC via USB.
2. Tap the phone’s notification and select **File Transfer**under the “Use USB for” option.
3. Access its memory through the computer’s File Explorer.
4. Select the files and folders you want to copy and transfer them to a new folder on your PC. You can then go through these files on your PC, delete what you don’t need, and organize everything before transferring the data to your new Pixel 8 device, but this is optional.

    ![copy data to the pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-14.jpg)

5. Disconnect the old phone from the computer.
6. Connect your new Pixel phone to the PC.
7. Once again, click the phone’s notification and select the **File Transfer**
8. Transfer the contents of your computer’s folder onto the new device.
9. Disconnect the new device after your files have been copied.

You’ll need to consider which types of files go into which folders. For example, you’ll need to ensure that music data goes into Android’s Music folder, pictures and videos go into Camera or DCIM folders, and documents and downloads have their respective folders, which are typical on Android.

## Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch

Another excellent option for transferring files to any Pixel phone is with Google’s Quick Switch adapters. These free OTG devices are included in every Pixel phone box and are designed to help you transfer data from an old phone to a new Pixel device.

A Quick Switch adapter connects to your Pixel phone, and you can insert a Samsung-compatible USB cable on the other end to start the transfer process.

Here’s what you’ll need to do:

1. Power on your new Pixel 8/8 Pro phone and click **Start**.
2. Plug the Quick Switch adapter into the Pixel device and connect the USB cable with the USB-A end into the Quick Switch. Connect the other end to the Samsung phone.
3. Unlock your Samsung device and click the **Copy**
4. Select the type of data you want to transfer and hit **Copy**.

Before you start the file transfer process using a Quick Switch, you should ensure both devices are fully charged. Furthermore, you should also update your Samsung device to the latest software version to avoid potential transfer issues, such as data corruption or incomplete transfers.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Pixel Using Google Drive

1. Using your old Samsung phone, navigate to **Settings**\> **Accounts and Backup**\> **Back up data** under **Google Drive**.
