Wondershare Dr.Fone also features other helpful tools, such as the De-Duplicate option, which automatically scans all your contacts for any repetitions, which is always a nuisance (you often end up with duplicate contacts if you sync your contacts with Facebook, as well as already having them on your device, for example).

## Mobogenie Android USB File Transfer

**Advantages:**

- Uninstall stock apps in batches.
- Easy-to-use interface.
- Easily download and manage apps.
- Easily transfer multiple files from your PC to your Android, and vice versa.
- Free of charge.

**Disadvantages:**

- USB only.

**Overview:**

Download Mobogenie and run it, and connect your Xiaomi Redmi K70 to the computer.

Once you have completed this process, you will be taken to the home screen:

![bluetooth android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/moborobo-home.jpg)

As with other data management software, you can download and install apps onto your Xiaomi Redmi K70 from your PC. The advantage of this is that apps can be downloaded quickly, and also without costing you in terms of data roaming charges.

![usb android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/download-app-with-mobogenie.jpg)

A neat feature is the ability to uninstall apps that came preloaded on the phone as often we find ourselves with apps that we never use that we cannot delete.

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Xiaomi Redmi K70 with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
