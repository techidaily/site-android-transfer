If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Nokia C300 to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Nokia C300 to iPhone Directly

However, most of the latest Nokia C300 models are now unable to run Nokia C300 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Nokia C300 to iPhone besides Nokia C300 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Nokia C300 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Nokia C300 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Nokia C300 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Nokia C300 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Nokia C300 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Nokia C300 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Nokia C300 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Nokia C300 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

![Nokia C300 to iPhone transfer with ShareIt.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/transfer-data-from-motorola-to-iphone-1.jpg)

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Nokia C300 to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Nokia C300 to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

## Part 2. How To Make iPhone to Nokia C300 Data Transfer Using Easy Software

As a solution, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone offers tools like Phone Transfer to simplify the process.
