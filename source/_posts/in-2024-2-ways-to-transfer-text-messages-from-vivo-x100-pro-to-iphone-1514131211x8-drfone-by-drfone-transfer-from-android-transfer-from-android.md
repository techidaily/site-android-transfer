![Vivo X100 Pro to iPhone transfer via cloud services.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/transfer-data-from-motorola-to-iphone-8.jpg)

## Conclusion

Transitioning from a Vivo X100 Pro device to an iPhone, or vice versa, may present challenges due to the difference in operating systems. However, with the right tools and methods, the **iPhone to Vivo X100 Pro data transfer** can be done seamlessly and efficiently.

Even though Vivo X100 Pro Migrate is no longer in the game, apps like ShareIt and Move to iOS can be alternatives for a direct transfer. If things get a bit trickier when transferring from iPhone to Vivo X100 Pro due to Apple's privacy measures, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone's Phone Transfer is there to simplify it all.

And for those who prefer the cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive also offer a solution. So, no matter your preference, there's a solution to ensure your data transfer moves smoothly.
