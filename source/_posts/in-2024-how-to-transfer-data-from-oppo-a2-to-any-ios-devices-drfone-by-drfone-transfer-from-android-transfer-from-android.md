NFC or Near Field Communication is another wireless means to transfer music from Oppo A2 to Other Android Devices. Although, unlike Bluetooth, this method requires contact between the two devices making the transfer.

**Below are the steps on how to transfer music from Oppo A2 to Other Android Devices using NFC.**

**Step 1.** First, enable NFC connection on both the Oppo A2 devices between which you want to transfer the music files. To switch on NFC on Android, go to Phone’s “Settings” and click on “More Settings” under “Wireless and Network” options. Now click on the NFC button to ensure that it is switched On. Do the same on the other Android device as well.
