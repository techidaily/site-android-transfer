## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Honor Magic 5 to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png" border="0">Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Honor Magic 5 device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Honor Magic 5 to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Honor Magic 5 to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Old Android to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Honor Magic 5 to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Honor Magic 5 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

- On your Honor Magic 5, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Honor Magic 5 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

- This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Honor Magic 5 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

- Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

![Transfer Photos from Honor Magic 5 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg)

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also, both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm the completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

Now, we’ll discuss how to transfer contacts from one Android to another with the help of a SIM card.

## Part 2: How to transfer contacts from Honor Magic 5 to Other Android Devices using SIM card?

Here are the steps which will help you.

- To copy the contacts to your SIM card, you should follow the sequence –
- Go to “contact” on your old device.
- Then tap on “More” and then choose “settings”.
- Here you can find “import / Export” option. Tap on it and then choose “Export” option.
- Now click on “Export to SIM card” option. On choosing this step, all your contacts will be copied to the SIM card in a few minutes. This depending upon the capacity of the SIM card.

![export to sim card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/05/14945039336575.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Now, pull the SIM card out and insert in on your new device.

• Here follow the same steps above and on “Import / Export” option, choose “Import”. Then it will ask for the option to import from. Choose “SIM Card” here. Now, all your contacts will be imported to your phone memory from the SIM card.

![import from sim card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/05/14945040941310.jpg)

## Part 3: How to transfer contacts from Honor Magic 5 to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct?

To transfer contacts from Honor Magic 5 to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct is one of the easiest methods. For this method, make sure that you should enable “Bluetooth” or “Wi-Fi Direct” on both the Android devices.

The steps:

1\. Go to the “Contacts” menu on your old Android device.

2\. Now, find “Import / Export” option. It might be under “More” > “Settings” menu. Tap on it.

3\. Now go to “Share namecard via” option from the menu and select all the contacts to transfer process.

This method is simple and easy to use.

There is yet another method to transfer contacts from Honor Magic 5 to Other Android Devices using Samsung’s own app “Smart Switch”.

Advantage: This is a very fast process.

Disadvantage : Sometimes the contacts are not saved automatically. You have to open the name card file one by one to save them. If you have a lot of contacts, this process is very hectic and lengthy.
