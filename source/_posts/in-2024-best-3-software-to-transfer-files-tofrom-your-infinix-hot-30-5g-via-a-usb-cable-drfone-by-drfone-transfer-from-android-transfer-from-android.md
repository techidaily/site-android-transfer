### Method 3: Google Drive \[Cloud Storages\]

Cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive provide a practical and effective method. This process enables effortless video transfer between an Android device and an iPad. Google Drive functions as a hub for storing, sharing, and accessing files among diverse internet-connected devices.

Nevertheless, a drawback to this method is the restricted complimentary storage space of 15GB offered by Google Drive. Below are the outlined steps to execute the process to **transfer videos from Infinix Hot 30 5G to iPad**:

- **Step 1.** First, download and install the Google Drive app on your Android and sign in using your Google account. Tap the "+ New" button, select "Upload" within the app, and pick the videos you want from your device's storage.
