The phone industry, for years, has constantly improved on the design and development of mobile phones being released into the market. One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.

Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device. Most users are at a loss about how to transfer their photos from one android device to another. There are several ways to do that successfully without the risk of losing your priced photos.

## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Find N3 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Oppo Find N3, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

<a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

![Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Oppo Find N3 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

![Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg)

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Oppo Find N3, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

![Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg)

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo Find N3 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

5\. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

## Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth

The Presence of Bluetooth technology in phones is as old as android itself. The use of this technology offers another method that you can employ in transferring your photos from your Oppo Find N3 to your new android device. It is a short and simple method that is known to most android users.

The purpose of this article is to guide you through the process of successfully transferring your photos from your Oppo Find N3 to your new android device. This process involves navigating to the Bluetooth option on your device, connecting to your new device and initiating transfer. The steps are outlined below

1\. Locate the Bluetooth on both devices. Go to your Settings and click on the "Connected device “Option. Under that option, you will find Bluetooth, click on it and toggle it on. Do the same for the receiving device.
