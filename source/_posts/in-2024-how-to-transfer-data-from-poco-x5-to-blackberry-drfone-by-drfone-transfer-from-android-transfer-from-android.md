Transferring data from one phone to another should be that simple right? Well, it is if you are using devices with the same OS. But, what should you do if you want to transfer data from, let’s say, Android to BlackBerry? Don’t worry. It is possible, and we will guide you step by step through the entire process.

## Option 1: Issues about transferring data from Poco X5 to BlackBerry

When transferring data from Poco X5 to BlackBerry, you can’t use Bluetooth or a third party software that will help you speed up the process. And unfortunately, you will sometimes wish that you can speed up this process. You can try to manually transfer data from Poco X5 to a computer, and then from a computer to BlackBerry, but this process can take hours. It is boring to transfer the files from one place to another, and the time it takes is a real pain in the neck. And also, it is impossible to transfer apps from Poco X5 to BlackBerry because of different operating systems. Sometimes, not even all photos, videos and music files will be compatible. But, luckily, the BlackBerry developers have thought of a one way, which is simpler than the manual transfer mentioned above, to transfer your data from Poco X5 to BlackBerry. It takes less time, but you still need to do some work.

## Part 2: How to transfer data from Poco X5 to Blackberry (Free)

The BlackBerry developers have thought of an app that will help you transfer your contacts, calendar videos and photos from and Android device to a BlackBerry. You will not need to connect the Poco X5 devices to a PC or Mac. You will only need to connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network. The app is called Device Switch.

From the Home screen of your BlackBerry tap the ‘BlackBerry World’.

## How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly

Since Poco X5 is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Poco X5, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Poco X5 to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Poco X5 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Poco X5 Migrate if you are a Poco X5 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Poco X5 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Poco X5 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Poco X5 models are now unable to run Poco X5 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Poco X5 to iPhone besides Poco X5 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Poco X5 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Poco X5 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Poco X5 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Poco X5 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Poco X5 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Poco X5 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Poco X5 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Poco X5 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

![Poco X5 to iPhone transfer with ShareIt.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/transfer-data-from-motorola-to-iphone-1.jpg)

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Poco X5 to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Poco X5 to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones. You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Poco X5 phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code
- On your Poco X5, a screen will appear to request a 6-10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Poco X5 device to make a secure connection between the two devices.

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

- **Step 5:** Transfer complete.
- Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process.

## Part 2. How To Make iPhone to Poco X5 Data Transfer Using Easy Software

One significant reason why data transfer from iPhone to Poco X5 is tricky is due to privacy concerns. Apple really prioritizes their user privacy. It implements strict security measures to prevent any breaches. While this is beneficial for users, it can also complicate data transfer.

Another contributing factor is the structure of the files. Android boasts a file system that is more straightforward, unlike iOS. As a solution, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone offers tools like Phone Transfer to simplify the process. With Dr. Fone's Phone Transfer, you can transfer any data from Poco X5 to iPhone or iPhone to Poco X5.



How to make **iPhone to Poco X5 data transfer** with Dr.Fone:

Make a connection between your iPhone and your Poco X5 phone through USB cable on your computer. Launch [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) on your computer and navigate to Toolbox > Phone Transfer.

![iPhone to Poco X5 data transfer using Dr.Fone.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

- **Step 2:** Specify the source and destination devices

After connecting them, the platform will identify the connected devices and load their data onto the platform. Choose the Source and Destination devices to set the transfer path. Use the Flip button if necessary to alter the transfer direction.

Now, Dr. Fone's Phone Transfer tool should prompt a specific operation on the window. Follow the instructions to turn off iCloud syncing. Open your iPhone Settings and tap on your device’s name. Go to iCloud > Photos to disable the toggle for iCloud Photos.

Both Dropbox and Google Drive serve as virtual storage spaces accessible from any device with an internet connection. Users can upload and store their files to the cloud, making them available for download on other devices.

Either Google Drive or Dropbox follows similar steps for data transfer. The difference between them is in the amount of free storage each service provides. Notably, Google Drive provides 15GB of free storage, while Dropbox offers 2GB.
