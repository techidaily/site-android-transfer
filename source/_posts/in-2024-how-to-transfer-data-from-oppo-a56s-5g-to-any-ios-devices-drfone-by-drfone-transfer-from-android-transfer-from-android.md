Many operating systems have a built-in Photos application to help you organize and view your pictures more efficiently. You may use it to organize your photos in separate folders and create a centralized hub for browsing.

### Add Tags to Your Photos

Organizing your files by their respective labels helps you find them easily instead of relying solely on visual cues. Consider including dates, locations, or key details in the filenames to make your photos easily identifiable.

**NOTE:** By incorporating these organization techniques, you can surely enjoy your memory collection on the larger canvas of your computer screen. Take advantage of these methods to transform your digital photo library into a well-ordered and easily accessible archive.
