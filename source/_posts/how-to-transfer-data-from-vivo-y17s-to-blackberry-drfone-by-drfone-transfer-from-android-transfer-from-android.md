## Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Vivo Y17s to iPad/iPhone

Transferring photos from your Vivo Y17s to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it's essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won't make the same errors.

**1\. Insufficient battery levels**

Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad/iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.

**2\. Limited storage space**

Overlooking available storage space on the iPad/iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad/iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.

**3\. Interference from Third-Party Apps:**

Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.

**4\. Ignoring file compatibility:**

Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.

**5\. Skipping App Permissions:**

When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it's common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.

## Part 5. 2 Methods To Transfer Contacts From iPhone to Android

This section will discuss two methods to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android. Similarly, in this iPhone-to-Android transfer case, the iPhone synchronization method and importing VCF file method can be used to move your contact list.

### Method 1. Enable iPhone Sync Feature

You can enable the iPhone Sync feature to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android device. In this case, ensure the contacts option in the Gmail synchronization is toggled on. Later, the contacts are saved when you sign in with the same Google account on your Vivo Y17s. Let's learn **how to transfer from phone to phone using this feature**:

- **Step 1.** Access the "Settings" app on your iPhone and navigate to the "Contacts" settings. Then, tap on "Accounts" and choose your Gmail account. Turn on the “Contacts” toggle switch to synchronize them.

**Note:** You can select "Add Account,” tap “Google," and input your credentials if your account has not been added yet.

- **Step 2.** Now, you have to install or access the “Google One” app on your Vivo Y17s. Sign in and configure your Google One settings. Then, navigate to the “Sync” section and tap the “View” option.

### Method 2. Import the VCF File

Importing a VCF file is another simple method for transferring contacts. It includes a vCard creation, in which contacts are saved. Then, this card can be downloaded from an iCloud account and imported to your Vivo Y17s. Moreover, this simple process does not involve any complicated steps to implement it. You can import a VCF file by following these simple steps.

- **Step 1.** At first, you will have to access “Settings” on your iPhone and tap your “Profile” icon at the top. After that, tap "iCloud," followed by the "Show All" option. Then,you need to toggle the “Contacts” switch to turn it on.
