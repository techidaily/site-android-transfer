<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Lava Agni 2 5G device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Lava Agni 2 5G to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

## How to Back Up Your Lava Agni 2 5G Before the Transfer

Data migration by means of the five methods enumerated above is considered safe and secure. However, it doesn’t mean that implementing preventive measures against data loss is no longer necessary.
