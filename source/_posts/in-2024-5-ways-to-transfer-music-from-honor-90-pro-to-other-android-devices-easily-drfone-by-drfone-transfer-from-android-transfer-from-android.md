Want to learn how to transfer messages from android to iPhone without USB cables and computers? With the below steps, you can easily transfer messages and other data from Honor 90 Pro to iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) using Move to iOS -

Step 1: Click on the “Move Data from Android” button on the “Apps and Data” screen during the iPhone setup process. If you have already set up the Honor 90 Pro device, then you need to erase the data from Settings > General > Reset and then go to Apps and Data screen.

![transfer messages from android to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/move-data-from-android.JPG "Apps and data screen")

Now, I’d like to introduce you how to transfer Android contacts to Outlook. Download this free trial version on your computer. Then check out the easy steps below.

### Step 1. Connect Android phone with a computer and run Dr.Fone

To start with, connect your Honor 90 Pro with a computer either via a USB cable. Run Dr.Fone on your computer and choose Transfer fron the main window Then, your Honor 90 Pro will be detected instantly. After that, the primary window will appears like the screenshot shows below.

### Step 2. Android to Outlook sync

Then, click "Contacts" under "Information" panel on the top. In the contact management window, choose the contacts that you want to export. Click "Export" button. When the drop-down menu pops up, you can either click "Export selected contacts to computer" or "Export all contacts to computer". After that, click "to Outlook Express" or "to Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013". Then, the contract transferring begins. Be sure your Honor 90 Pro is connected all the time.

As you see, apart from exporting Android contacts to Outlook, you can also copy contacts from Honor 90 Pro to vCard, Windows Live Mail and Windows Address Book. If you have a Gmail account, you’re able to export Android contacts to your computer, and then backup these Android contacts to your Gmail account too.
