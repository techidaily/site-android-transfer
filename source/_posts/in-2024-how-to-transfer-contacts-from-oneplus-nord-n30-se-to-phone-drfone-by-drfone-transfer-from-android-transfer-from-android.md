## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From OnePlus Nord N30 SE to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## Part 3. How to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?

Bluetooth transfer is one of the oldest methods that can be used to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Other Android Devices, and it is a simple way to make use of it.

**Here are the steps to follow to know how to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Other Android Devices.**

**Step 1.** There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your OnePlus Nord N30 SE

**Method 1:** The first method is to swipe from top to down on your OnePlus Nord N30 SE to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.

**Method 2:** Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your OnePlus Nord N30 SE, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.

**Step 2.** Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.

Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.

**Step 3.** The final step is to head to the File Manager app on your phone or go to your Music Player, select the music file you wish to transfer, and then click on your device's Share button or logo.

Here, scroll until you see the “Bluetooth” option. You will be immediately prompted to select the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device to share with, click the earlier paired device name, and then click on “Accept” on the other device.

This is how you can transfer music files from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth.

## Part 4. How to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Other Android Devices using NFC?

NFC or Near Field Communication is another wireless means to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Other Android Devices. Although, unlike Bluetooth, this method requires contact between the two devices making the transfer.

**Below are the steps on how to transfer music from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Other Android Devices using NFC.**

**Step 1.** First, enable NFC connection on both the OnePlus Nord N30 SE devices between which you want to transfer the music files. To switch on NFC on Android, go to Phone’s “Settings” and click on “More Settings” under “Wireless and Network” options. Now click on the NFC button to ensure that it is switched On.
