## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Infinix Smart 7 HD device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly

Since Infinix Smart 7 HD is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Infinix Smart 7 HD, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Infinix Smart 7 HD Migrate if you are a Infinix Smart 7 HD user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Infinix Smart 7 HD devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Infinix Smart 7 HD device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Infinix Smart 7 HD models are now unable to run Infinix Smart 7 HD Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone besides Infinix Smart 7 HD Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Infinix Smart 7 HD Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Infinix Smart 7 HD and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Infinix Smart 7 HD and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Infinix Smart 7 HD device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Infinix Smart 7 HD device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Infinix Smart 7 HD device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Infinix Smart 7 HD phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone via Apps & Data

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Infinix Smart 7 HD phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.
