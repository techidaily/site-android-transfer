## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Itel S23+ to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Itel S23+ Migrate if you are a Itel S23+ user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Itel S23+ devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Itel S23+ device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Itel S23+ models are now unable to run Itel S23+ Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Itel S23+ to iPhone besides Itel S23+ Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Itel S23+ Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Itel S23+ to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Itel S23+ and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Itel S23+ and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Itel S23+ device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Itel S23+ device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Itel S23+ device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Itel S23+ phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Itel S23+ to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Itel S23+ to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."
