### Method 2: iTunes

Using iTunes to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad involves a slightly indirect process. The variance in operating systems is the primary reason for this distinction. iTunes is primarily tailored for iOS devices; however, with supplemental steps, it can be utilized to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad. Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G and copy or move the desired videos from your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G.

- **Step 2.** Access the "File" menu and choose either "Add File to Library" or "Add Folder to Library." Proceed by locating and selecting the transferred videos to import them into your iTunes library.

- **Step 3.** Connect your computer to the iPad using a USB cable to enable iTunes recognition of your iPad. Click on the iPad icon positioned at the top-left corner of iTunes. Next, navigate to the "Movies" tab located in the left sidebar to continue the process.
