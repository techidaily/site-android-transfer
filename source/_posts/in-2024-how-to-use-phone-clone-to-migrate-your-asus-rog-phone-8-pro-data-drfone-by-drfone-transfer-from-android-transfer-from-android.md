## Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch

Another excellent option for transferring files to any Pixel phone is with Google’s Quick Switch adapters. These free OTG devices are included in every Pixel phone box and are designed to help you transfer data from an old phone to a new Pixel device.

A Quick Switch adapter connects to your Pixel phone, and you can insert a Samsung-compatible USB cable on the other end to start the transfer process.

Here’s what you’ll need to do:

1. Power on your new Pixel 8/8 Pro phone and click **Start**.
2. Plug the Quick Switch adapter into the Pixel device and connect the USB cable with the USB-A end into the Quick Switch. Connect the other end to the Samsung phone.
3. Unlock your Samsung device and click the **Copy**
4. Select the type of data you want to transfer and hit **Copy**.

    ![copy data with quick switch adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-15.jpg)
