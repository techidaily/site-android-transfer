Since it is a complete Android phone manager, you can use it to transfer all the other kinds of data (like photos, videos, contacts, messages, and more) from one source to another. Unlike Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer that moves all the music files at once, you can perform a selective data transfer. The interface will provide a preview of your data so that you can choose the files you wish to move. To learn how to transfer music from Honor X50i+ to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

    Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Honor X50i+ to iTunes as well. To do this, you need to select the “Transfer Device Media to iTunes” option from its home page. This will launch a pop-up window and let you move your music files from the Android device to iTunes directly.

In this way, you can selectively transfer music from Honor X50i+ to iPhone in a hassle-free manner.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Honor X50i+ to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Honor X50i+ to your system. Though, to transfer music from Honor X50i+ to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
