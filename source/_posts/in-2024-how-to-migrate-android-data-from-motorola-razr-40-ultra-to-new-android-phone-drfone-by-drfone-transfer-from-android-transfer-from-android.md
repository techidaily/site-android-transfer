After that, click "to Outlook Express" or "to Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013". Then, the contract transferring begins. Be sure your Motorola Razr 40 Ultra is connected all the time.

As you see, apart from exporting Android contacts to Outlook, you can also copy contacts from Motorola Razr 40 Ultra to vCard, Windows Live Mail and Windows Address Book. If you have a Gmail account, you’re able to export Android contacts to your computer, and then backup these Android contacts to your Gmail account too.
