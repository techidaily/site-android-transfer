PhoneCopy can back up your calendar events, SMS, tasks, and notes and can help you import them on a different phone (typically on iPhone).

Cons:

Only up to 500 contacts, SMS, tasks, and notes can be synched while using the Basic version (free account) of PhoneCopy. To remove this restriction, you must buy the Premium version for which PhoneCopy charges $25 annually.

The archived data is auto-deleted from the PhoneCopy server after one month when using the Basic version, and after 1 year when using the Premium version.
