## Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to iPhone?

These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them. The good thing about these streaming services is that you can access your music from multiple devices. For instance, let’s consider the example of Spotify.

Once you have created a playlist on your Spotify account, you can access it from any other device. You can even access your music by visiting its website because it will be stored on Spotify’s server and not your device itself.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-transfer streaming music](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-4.jpg)

If you are moving from an Android to an iPhone, you can follow these steps to ensure your Spotify music won’t be lost.

- Launch Spotify on your Oppo Find X7 Ultra and go to the Playlist tab. From here, you can create a playlist. Later, you can add your favorite songs to this playlist as well. You can even create multiple playlists on the app.

Once you have completed this process, you will be taken to the home screen:

![bluetooth android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/moborobo-home.jpg)

The transfer of photo files is straightforward, and several photos can be selected from your computer to import onto your device at once, or vice versa.

![usb to android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/transfer-photos-with-mobogenie.jpg)

**Features:**

- Download apps onto it through app store.
- Simple to use.

**Overview:**

Download MoboRobo and install this Android USB file transfer tool on your computer. Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your Oppo Find X7 Ultra with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your Oppo Find X7 Ultra as well.

Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.

![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Oppo Find X7 Ultra with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
