## Part 3. Using Official Tools to Transfer Data from Motorola to Samsung

Samsung Smart Switch is an official tool developed by Samsung. This tool is designed to simplify transferring data from an old device, including non-Samsung devices like Motorola, to a new Samsung smartphone or tablet. This tool supports various data types, such as contacts, photos, messages, videos, calendars, and music. You can use the steps given below to transfer your data from Motorola to Samsung using Smart Switch:

**Step 1.** Begin with ensuring the Smart Switch app is installed on both devices. It comes pre-installed on Samsung devices, and you can download it from the Google Play Store for Motorola. Now, launch the app on both devices and keep both devices near each other.
