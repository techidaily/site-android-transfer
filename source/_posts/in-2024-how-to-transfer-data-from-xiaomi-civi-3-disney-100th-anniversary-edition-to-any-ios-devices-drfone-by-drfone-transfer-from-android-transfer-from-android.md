## Part 3: How to transfer music from Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition to your system. Though, to transfer music from Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes.

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
