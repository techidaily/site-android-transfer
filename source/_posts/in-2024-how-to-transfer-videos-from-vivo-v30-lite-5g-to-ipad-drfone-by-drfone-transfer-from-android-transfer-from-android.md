As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Vivo V30 Lite 5G with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
