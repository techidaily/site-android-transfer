However, most of the latest Vivo S18 models are now unable to run Vivo S18 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Vivo S18 to iPhone besides Vivo S18 Migrate.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Vivo S18 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Vivo S18 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
