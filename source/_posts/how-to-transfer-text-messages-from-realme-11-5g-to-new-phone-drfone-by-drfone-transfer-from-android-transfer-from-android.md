## How to Organize the Photos on Your Computer

While smartphones offer convenience for snapping photos on the go, viewing your pictures is doubtlessly much better on a computer. Why not? Computers apparently have larger screens that increase image quality to another level. However, finding a specific photo in your desktop storage can be a daunting experience if your files are unorganized. Don’t worry. Listed below are some useful organization techniques that can help you a lot in this regard.

### Add the Image Folders to the Photos Application

Many operating systems have a built-in Photos application to help you organize and view your pictures more efficiently. You may use it to organize your photos in separate folders and create a centralized hub for browsing.

### Add Tags to Your Photos

Tagging your photos is a versatile way to categorize and organize them based on themes, events, or people. Most photo management applications allow you to add descriptive tags that make it easy to search the media files later. This is particularly useful for quickly locating pictures of specific occasions or individuals.

### Keep Your Photos in Separate Folders

Make it a habit to create separate folders for different events, locations, or time periods. This organization method helps you maintain a clear structure for your photo collection. For example, you might have folders for vacations, family gatherings, or special occasions. Organizing photos this way simplifies navigation and ensures that each set of pictures is kept properly.

### Rename Your Photo

Give your photos descriptive and unique filenames that reflect either their content or context. Organizing your files by their respective labels helps you find them easily instead of relying solely on visual cues. Consider including dates, locations, or key details in the filenames to make your photos easily identifiable.

**NOTE:** By incorporating these organization techniques, you can surely enjoy your memory collection on the larger canvas of your computer screen. Take advantage of these methods to transform your digital photo library into a well-ordered and easily accessible archive.

**Note:** To transfer data to or from iPhone (iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X supported), iPad and iPod, you should install iTunes on the computer.

### Step 2. Connect your old and new phones to the computer

As I mentioned above, Dr.Fone lets you export SMS on the old Nokia phone, Android phone and even iPhone, and then copy them to your new iPhone or Android phone. So, connect two phones to do the SMS transfer to the computer with USB cables. After detected, the old phone is shown on the left, named as the source phone, and the new Android phone or iPhone, the destination phone appears on the right.

Besides, "Flip" between two phones lets you change places of the two phones.

### Step 3. Transfer text messages to new phone

Besides text messages, Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer empowers you to transfer other files, like contacts, music, and photos. Therefore, remove the marks before other files when you just want to move text messages to the new phone. Then, click "Start Transfer". Please never disconnect either phone before the transfer is done. When it's done, click "OK". That's all about how to transfer texts to a new phone.
