But with regard to data transfer and file synchronization, you don’t have to worry a lot. There are many ways you can try to quickly **transfer data from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone 15.**

In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to **transfer data from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone 15** conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.


## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Huawei Nova Y91 device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone 15 conveniently.

### II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps

Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Huawei Nova Y91 to iOS.

There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.

Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device

Step 2: Keep the Huawei Nova Y91 devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Huawei Nova Y91 devices are in different rooms or too far away.

Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Huawei Nova Y91 devices

Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android

Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device

Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices

Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.

Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.

Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.

That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.

**Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods**

It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.

In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Huawei Nova Y91 devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes!

Step 3: Click on the Switch option on the Dr.Fone utility home screen and it will take you to Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer interface.

Step 4: Both the Android and iPhone will be displayed on the next screen. Select the Android device as the Source and iPhone as the destination using the Flip button.

Step 5: Now, select the data that you want to transfer by checking the respective option. In this case, only check the Text messages checkbox and uncheck everything else.

Step 6: Finally hit the “Start Transfer” button and it will begin to transfer text messages from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone.

Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer offers a safe and quick way to transfer messages from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max). Moreover, it can work both on new and old target iPhone. Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer is also compatible with a variety of iOS devices and iOS versions, so it doesn’t have any restrictions for transferring data.



## Part 2: Transfer SMS from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone using Move to iOS app

Transferring text messages from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer is the best and the fastest way. But it requires a computer and physically connecting the Huawei Nova Y91 devices via USB cables. What if the person doesn’t have a computer? They won’t be able to transfer any data from their old Android to a new iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max). If you want to find another way to transfer messages and other stuff from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone, then Move to the iOS app can help in this task.

Move to iOS is an Android app developed to make it easier to transfer data from Huawei Nova Y91 to iOS devices. It is available for free at Google Play Store and is of the minuscule size of approximately 2.2 MB. One doesn’t need to wait extreme time to install the app. With Move to iOS, you will be able to set up the iOS device easily without needing to connect it with a USB cable. But there are some prerequisites that you have to fulfill before you can transfer data from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) or an earlier model-

- • The iPhone must have iOS 9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17
- • iPhone 5 or later is required
- • Android 4.0 and above
- • The iPhone hasn’t been set up yet or the data has been erased
- • Data doesn’t exceed the storage on iPhone
- • Steady Wi-Fi network is available

### How to transfer text messages from Android and iPhone using Move to iOS?

Want to learn how to transfer messages from android to iPhone without USB cables and computers? With the below steps, you can easily transfer messages and other data from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) using Move to iOS -

Step 1: Click on the “Move Data from Android” button on the “Apps and Data” screen during the iPhone setup process. If you have already set up the Huawei Nova Y91 device, then you need to erase the data from Settings > General > Reset and then go to Apps and Data screen.

![transfer messages from android to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/move-data-from-android.JPG "Apps and data screen")

Step 2: On the iPhone, click “Continue” on the Move from Android screen. It will generate the 6-digit or 10-digit code.

Step 3: Now on the Android device, download and install the Move to iOS app and open it.

Step 4: Tap on “Continue” and then “Agree” on the terms and conditions screen and then “Next” on the “Find Your Code” screen.

Step 5: Enter the code generated on the iPhone in the “Enter Code” screen.

![enter code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/enter-code.JPG "enter the code to verify")

Step 6: On the Transfer Data screen, select the content to transfer and click “Next”. It will start the transfer process and will take some time to complete depending on the size of the data.

Step 7: After transferring is complete, finish the iPhone device setup process.

The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from Huawei Nova Y91 to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method. They can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) for the task.
