## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Samsung Galaxy M34 5G to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.
- **Step 3:** Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you'll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.
- **Step 4:** Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.
