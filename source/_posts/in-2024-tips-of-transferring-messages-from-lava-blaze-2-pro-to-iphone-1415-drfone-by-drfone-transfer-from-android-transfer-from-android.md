## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Lava Blaze 2 Pro to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Lava Blaze 2 Pro before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Lava Blaze 2 Pro, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Lava Blaze 2 Pro’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.
- **Step 3:** Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you'll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.
- **Step 4:** Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.

### How to transfer Android messages to iPhone 12/XS (Max) using Move to iOS app

The first method to transfer text messages from Lava Blaze 2 Pro to iPhone 12/XS (Max) is using the official Move to iOS app from Apple. Message history, call logs, contacts, web bookmarks, apps, etc. can be transferred from your Android to any iOS device. Though, I have noticed the app was acting strangely during data transfer. My Wi-Fi got some issues, and Move to iOS couldn’t properly complete the transfer.

**Guide for Move to iOS** **to transfer messages from Lava Blaze 2 Pro to iPhone 12/XS (Max)**

1. Download, install, and launch Move to iOS on your Lava Blaze 2 Pro.
2. Get the iPhone 12/XS (Max) and configure the setup and then connect to Wi-Fi. Browse to the ‘Apps & Data’ option, click ‘Move Data from Android’ thereafter. Click the ‘Continue’ button and note the passcode.

3. On your Lava Blaze 2 Pro, click ‘Continue’ and then press ‘Agree’. When prompted for a passcode, enter the one you got from iPhone 12/XS (Max).

4. Ensure that the Android phone is also connected to Wi-Fi. Now, click on ‘Messages’ from the ‘Data Transfer’ option. Click ‘Next’ and wait a while to finish the data transfer. Hit the ‘Done’ button afterward once the iPhone 12/XS (Max) gets synched with these messages, set up your iCloud account, and view the messages.

### How to transfer Android messages to iPhone 12/XS (Max) using SMS Backup+

You can learn how to transfer messages from Lava Blaze 2 Pro to iPhone 12/XS (Max) without a computer using the SMS Backup+ app. It can automatically backup the SMS, call logs, MMS using a different label in Google Calendar and Gmail. Remember that MMS can’t be restored later.

**Here is how to transfer messages from Lava Blaze 2 Pro to iPhone 12/XS (Max) with SMS Backup+:**

1. Get the Android phone and sign in to your ‘Gmail account’ and press ‘Settings’. Go to ‘Forwarding and POP/IMAP’. Now, tap ‘Enable IMAP’ and click ‘Save Changes’.
2. Download SMS Backup+ on your Lava Blaze 2 Pro from Google Play Store and launch it. Tap ‘Connect’ choose the recently used Gmail account. Now, allow the app to backup the SMS to your Gmail account and hit ‘Backup’.

    ![transfer messages from android to iPhone XS (Max) using sms backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/sms-backup.jpg)

3. Now, since you’ve backed up your messages to Gmail, you can simply access and view them from any device. Simply launch Gmail with the same account, and you’ll be able to get hold of all your messages right on your iPhone 12/XS (Max).

**Note:** _The messages will be enclosed in an Email attachment. That implies you won’t be able to import your messages to your iMessage app. If you want to transfer SMS to the default messages app, try Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer. It's a one-click and reliable desktop software._
