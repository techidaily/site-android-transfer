### Step 2. Connect your old and new phones to the computer

As I mentioned above, Dr.Fone lets you export SMS on the old Nokia phone, Android phone and even iPhone, and then copy them to your new iPhone or Android phone. So, connect two phones to do the SMS transfer to the computer with USB cables. After detected, the old phone is shown on the left, named as the source phone, and the new Android phone or iPhone, the destination phone appears on the right.

Besides, "Flip" between two phones lets you change places of the two phones.

### Step 3. Transfer text messages to new phone

Besides text messages, Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer empowers you to transfer other files, like contacts, music, and photos. Therefore, remove the marks before other files when you just want to move text messages to the new phone. Then, click "Start Transfer". Please never disconnect either phone before the transfer is done. When it's done, click "OK". That's all about how to transfer texts to a new phone.
