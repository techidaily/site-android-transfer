### Step 2. Android to Outlook sync

Then, click "Contacts" under "Information" panel on the top. In the contact management window, choose the contacts that you want to export. Click "Export" button. When the drop-down menu pops up, you can either click "Export selected contacts to computer" or "Export all contacts to computer". After that, click "to Outlook Express" or "to Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013". Then, the contract transferring begins. Be sure your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G is connected all the time.

As you see, apart from exporting Android contacts to Outlook, you can also copy contacts from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to vCard, Windows Live Mail and Windows Address Book. If you have a Gmail account, youâ€™re able to export Android contacts to your computer, and then backup these Android contacts to your Gmail account too.
