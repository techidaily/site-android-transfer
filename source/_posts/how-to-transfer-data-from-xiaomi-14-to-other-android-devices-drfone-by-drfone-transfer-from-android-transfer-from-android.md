## Part 6: Clone Xiaomi 14 Phone Using Bluetooth

Using Bluetooth for cloning an Android phone is not the most efficient method. It is more suitable for transferring specific files than creating a comprehensive clone. Moreover, it's a slow and manual process that requires you to select and transfer files one by one. Here's how you can use Bluetooth for this purpose:

1\. On both Android devices, turn on Bluetooth and pair the Xiaomi 14 devices. Navigate to the file you want to send on the source device, tap "Share," and select "Bluetooth."

2\. Now, choose the targeted device to send the file. Move to the other device and "Accept" the incoming file transfer.
