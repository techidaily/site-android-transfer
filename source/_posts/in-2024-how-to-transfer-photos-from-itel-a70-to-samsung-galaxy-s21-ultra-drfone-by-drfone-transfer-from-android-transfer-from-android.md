## Part 3. How to transfer music from Itel A70 to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?

Bluetooth transfer is one of the oldest methods that can be used to transfer music from Itel A70 to Other Android Devices, and it is a simple way to make use of it.

**Here are the steps to follow to know how to transfer music from Itel A70 to Other Android Devices.**

**Step 1.** There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your Itel A70

**Method 1:** The first method is to swipe from top to down on your Itel A70 to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.

**Method 2:** Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your Itel A70, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.

![transfer music from android to android-Go to “Connection”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-8.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.

Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.

![transfer music from android to android-pair both devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-9.jpg)

**Step 3.** The final step is to head to the File Manager app on your phone or go to your Music Player, select the music file you wish to transfer, and then click on your device's Share button or logo.

Here, scroll until you see the “Bluetooth” option. You will be immediately prompted to select the Itel A70 device to share with, click the earlier paired device name, and then click on “Accept” on the other device.

This is how you can transfer music files from Itel A70 to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth.
