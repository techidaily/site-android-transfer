## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Vivo G2 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Vivo G2 Migrate if you are a Vivo G2 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Vivo G2 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Vivo G2 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Vivo G2 models are now unable to run Vivo G2 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Vivo G2 to iPhone besides Vivo G2 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Vivo G2 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Vivo G2 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Vivo G2 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Vivo G2 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Vivo G2 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Vivo G2 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Vivo G2 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Vivo G2 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

![Vivo G2 to iPhone transfer with ShareIt.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/transfer-data-from-motorola-to-iphone-1.jpg)

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Vivo G2 to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Vivo G2 to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones. You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Vivo G2 phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code
- On your Vivo G2, a screen will appear to request a 6-10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Vivo G2 device to make a secure connection between the two devices.

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

- **Step 5:** Transfer complete.
- Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process.

## Part 2. How To Make iPhone to Vivo G2 Data Transfer Using Easy Software

One significant reason why data transfer from iPhone to Vivo G2 is tricky is due to privacy concerns. Apple really prioritizes their user privacy. It implements strict security measures to prevent any breaches. While this is beneficial for users, it can also complicate data transfer.

Another contributing factor is the structure of the files. Android boasts a file system that is more straightforward, unlike iOS. As a solution, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone offers tools like Phone Transfer to simplify the process. With Dr. Fone's Phone Transfer, you can transfer any data from Vivo G2 to iPhone or iPhone to Vivo G2.



How to make **iPhone to Vivo G2 data transfer** with Dr.Fone:

- **Step 1:** Open Dr.Fone’s Phone Transfer tool
