![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Xiaomi 13 Ultra with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Xiaomi 13 Ultra to iPhone besides Xiaomi 13 Ultra Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Xiaomi 13 Ultra Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Xiaomi 13 Ultra to iPhone transfer**.

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Xiaomi 13 Ultra device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
