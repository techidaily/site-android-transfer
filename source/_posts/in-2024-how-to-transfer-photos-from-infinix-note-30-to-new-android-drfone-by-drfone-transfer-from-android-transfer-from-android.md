## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Infinix Note 30 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Infinix Note 30, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Infinix Note 30 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Infinix Note 30 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg)

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Infinix Note 30, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg)

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Infinix Note 30 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

5\. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

- **Step 1.** Connect your Infinix Note 30 and copy or move the desired videos from your Infinix Note 30 to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Infinix Note 30.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Infinix Note 30 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Infinix Note 30 Migrate if you are a Infinix Note 30 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Infinix Note 30 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Infinix Note 30 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Infinix Note 30 models are now unable to run Infinix Note 30 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Infinix Note 30 to iPhone besides Infinix Note 30 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Infinix Note 30 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Infinix Note 30 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Infinix Note 30 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Infinix Note 30 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Infinix Note 30 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Infinix Note 30 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Infinix Note 30 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Infinix Note 30 to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Infinix Note 30 to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones. You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Infinix Note 30 phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.
