- **Step 1: Open Dr.Fone and Connect iPad and Android**

Connect your Android and iPad to the computer and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone. Click "Toolbox" from the left side panel and choose "Phone Transfer." It will lead to the Phone Transfer window with Wondershare Dr.Fone recognizing both of your devices.

- **Step 2: Define Source and Destination Positions**

Here, ensure that the Android device is on "Source" while the iPad is on the "Destination" position. Use the "Flip" switch if the positions are wrong. Now, choose the videos and other data you want to transfer and hit "Start Transfer." This will kickstart the transfer process of videos between devices.

### Method 2: iTunes

Using iTunes to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad involves a slightly indirect process. The variance in operating systems is the primary reason for this distinction. iTunes is primarily tailored for iOS devices; however, with supplemental steps, it can be utilized to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad. Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Vivo Y17s and copy or move the desired videos from your Vivo Y17s to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Vivo Y17s.

- **Step 2.** Access the "File" menu and choose either "Add File to Library" or "Add Folder to Library." Proceed by locating and selecting the transferred videos to import them into your iTunes library.

- **Step 3.** Connect your computer to the iPad using a USB cable to enable iTunes recognition of your iPad. Click on the iPad icon positioned at the top-left corner of iTunes. Next, navigate to the "Movies" tab located in the left sidebar to continue the process.

- **Step 4.** Select the "Sync Movies" option by checking the corresponding box and pick out the specific videos you wish to move to your iPad. Afterward, proceed by clicking the "Apply" button to commence the transfer process of the chosen videos from iTunes to your iPad.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are various methods to transfer videos from Vivo Y17s to iPad that offer distinct advantages. Wireless options like Google Drive and email are convenient. At the same time, wired methods such as using iTunes and the many capabilities of Wondershare Dr.Fone stand out. For comprehensive transfers, Dr.Fone emerges as a reliable solution. It offers versatile tools like Phone Manager and Phone Transfer, and its robust functionalities make it a recommended choice.
