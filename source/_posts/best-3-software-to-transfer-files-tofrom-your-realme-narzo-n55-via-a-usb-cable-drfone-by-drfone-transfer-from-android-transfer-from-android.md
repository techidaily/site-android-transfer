However, most of the latest Realme Narzo N55 models are now unable to run Realme Narzo N55 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015.

In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Realme Narzo N55 to iPhone besides Realme Narzo N55 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Realme Narzo N55 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Realme Narzo N55 to iPhone transfer**.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Realme Narzo N55 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Realme Narzo N55 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Realme Narzo N55 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Realme Narzo N55 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

For more details, follow the instructions below:
