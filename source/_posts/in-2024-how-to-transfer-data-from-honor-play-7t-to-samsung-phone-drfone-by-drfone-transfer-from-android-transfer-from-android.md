![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move from android to ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-8.jpg)

- **Step 5:** On your Honor Play 7T, enter the 12-digit code of the iPhone. This is so that the ‘Move to iOS’ app knows which iOS device it has to transfer the data to.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-enrer the code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-9.jpg)

- **Step 6:** Before the transfer starts, you will be asked several questions, like do you want to transfer Google Account information, Bookmarks, etc. Now, since you only wish to videos and photos, deselect the other options except ‘Camera Roll.’

The above process to **transfer pictures from Honor Play 7T to iPhone** is suitable for mobile users who are unwilling to invest money in software. However, the method is not perfect because it is time-consuming. The transaction can neither be done quickly nor can it be done with a single click.

**Note:** This solution only works when you set up the iPhone. If the iPhone is already set up, you need to factory reset it and set it up to restore photos with this App. If you'd like to save existing data after transferring, [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) is a good solution.
