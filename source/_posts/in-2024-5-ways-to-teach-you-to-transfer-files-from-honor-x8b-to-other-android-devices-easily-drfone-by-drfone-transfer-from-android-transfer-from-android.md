Although there has been no record of such occurrence in the past from users who export contacts from Honor X8b to Gmail, it is still advisable to perform a backup.

Another way to back up your contacts before you sync contacts from Honor X8b to Gmail can be found in this article: [Four Ways to Backup Android Contacts Easily](https://drfone.wondershare.com/contacts/backup-contacts-android.html).

## Part 4. Basic Solutions to Fix Google Contacts Syncing Issues on Android

In the above parts, you have learned how to transfer contacts from Honor X8b to Gmail. So what if your contacts have, for some reason, refused to sync? Well, don't panic; here are some of the possible fixes for the problem.

Ensure that the Sync option is turned on for your device. To do this, simply:

1. Tap on Settings for your device
2. Go to Data Usage, then go to Menu.
3. Ensure that the "Auto-Sync data" option is active on your device, if not, activate it.
4. If it is already turned on, try toggling it on and off a few times, then proceed to Sync your Contacts.

Ensure that Google Contacts sync is turned on. To do this, simply:

- Once again, go to Android Settings.

1. Go to the "Accounts" option.
2. Go to the Google Account that you have used as your backup preference.
3. Make sure that the "Contacts" option for the sync data is turned on.
4. If it is already on and is still not working, try toggling the option on and off a few times.

Make sure that you have an active Internet connection, and that background data is switched off. The importance of checking your Internet connection before proceeding to more extreme measures for all issues cannot be ignored. The issues that may be disturbing you might be due to an issue with your device's connection to the Internet

1. Switch Off and Switch On your Data Connection.
2. Go to Settings, then go to "Data Usage" and ensure that Restricting Background Data is disabled on your device.

Clear the App Cache for Google Contacts.

1. Go to Settings
2. Then tap on "Apps" or "Apps Manager," depending on your device and Android version.
3. Go to all Apps and find Contact Sync.
4. Select Clear Cache and also Clear Data.
5. This should knock the Contacts sync back to normal and ensure that your sync goes on without a hitch from there on out.

Remove your Google Account and set up again. The issue you are facing might be due to a malfunctioning Google Account setup. To fix this:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Go to Accounts, then proceed to your Google Account.
3. Select the Remove Account option
4. Then proceed to set up your email account again.

As a last-ditch fix, some users have reported that an account merging for the contacts fixed the problems of the contacts not syncing. To do this, do the following steps:

1. Go to Contacts
2. Tap on the menu, then tap on "Contacts to Display" option
3. Select "Only Device". Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Honor X8b device to display.
4. Tap on "Menu" and then on "Merge Accounts"
5. Select Google Merge. This will merge all your Contacts with Google.
6. Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting "Contacts to Display", then "All Contacts"
7. This should make all the contacts on your device to appear, and your sync problem should also be solved.

These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account. It is also worthy of note that if you want new contacts to be saved automatically to your Google account, you have to select the Google Account option when prompted on where to save the new contact, or else, the contact will not be automatically synced to your Gmail account, and you will have to create an export to add it to your Google Contacts.

Also, keep in mind that it might take a longer period of time for the contacts to synchronize to Google on a slower network connection, in deviance to a fast network connection, so you might need to exercise some patience if you're on a slower Internet connection.

It can sometimes be bewildering and baffling when people probably lose their phones, and then they complain of loss of contacts. However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts. All the methods mentioned above are easy to execute and will help you transfer contacts from the phone to Gmail in a snap.

Lastly, you can also use [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html) for smoothly exporting contacts from Honor X8b to Gmail.
