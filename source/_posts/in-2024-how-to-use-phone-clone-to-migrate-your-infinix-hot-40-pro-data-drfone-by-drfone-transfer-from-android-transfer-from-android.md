1. Open the ‘Contacts’ app and click on ‘More’. Go to the ‘Import/Export’ or simply ‘Export Contacts’ option there.
2. Click on ‘Export to SIM’ or ‘SIM card’ and then select the source of contacts i.e. ‘Phone’/’WhatsApp’/’Google’/’Messenger’.

![transfer contacts from Infinix Hot 40 Pro to iPhone XS (Max) via sim card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/export-android-contacts-to-sim.jpg)

1. Then hit ‘Export’ and ‘Continue’ afterward.
2. Now, open the SIM card slot of your Infinix Hot 40 Pro and unmount the SIM. Insert it on your iPhone XS/11 and turn it on. You can find the contacts on your iPhone.

**Note:** _Though, it’s rare nowadays. In case you happen to own a very old SIM card and your Infinix Hot 40 Pro supported the size. You might need to cut it to fit the iPhone XS/11’s micro-SIM slot._

### How to transfer Android messages to iPhone 12/XS (Max) using Move to iOS app

The first method to transfer text messages from Infinix Hot 40 Pro to iPhone 12/XS (Max) is using the official Move to iOS app from Apple. Message history, call logs, contacts, web bookmarks, apps, etc. can be transferred from your Android to any iOS device. Though, I have noticed the app was acting strangely during data transfer. My Wi-Fi got some issues, and Move to iOS couldn’t properly complete the transfer.

**Guide for Move to iOS** **to transfer messages from Infinix Hot 40 Pro to iPhone 12/XS (Max)**

1. Download, install, and launch Move to iOS on your Infinix Hot 40 Pro.
2. Get the iPhone 12/XS (Max) and configure the setup and then connect to Wi-Fi. Browse to the ‘Apps & Data’ option, click ‘Move Data from Android’ thereafter. Click the ‘Continue’ button and note the passcode.

    ![transfer messages from android to iPhone XS (Max) with move to ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15150785955979.jpg)
