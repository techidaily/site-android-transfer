## Part 5. 2 Methods To Transfer Contacts From iPhone to Android

This section will discuss two methods to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android. Similarly, in this iPhone-to-Android transfer case, the iPhone synchronization method and importing VCF file method can be used to move your contact list.

### Method 1. Enable iPhone Sync Feature

You can enable the iPhone Sync feature to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android device. In this case, ensure the contacts option in the Gmail synchronization is toggled on. Later, the contacts are saved when you sign in with the same Google account on your Realme GT Neo 5 SE. Let's learn **how to transfer from phone to phone using this feature**:

- **Step 1.** Access the "Settings" app on your iPhone and navigate to the "Contacts" settings. Then, tap on "Accounts" and choose your Gmail account. Turn on the “Contacts” toggle switch to synchronize them.

- **Step 2.** Now, you have to install or access the “Google One” app on your Realme GT Neo 5 SE. Sign in and configure your Google One settings. Then, navigate to the “Sync” section and tap the “View” option.

### Method 2. Import the VCF File

Then, this card can be downloaded from an iCloud account and imported to your Realme GT Neo 5 SE. Moreover, this simple process does not involve any complicated steps to implement it. You can import a VCF file by following these simple steps.
