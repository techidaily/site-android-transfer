## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Old Android to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Motorola Moto G84 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

- On your Motorola Moto G84 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

- This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

- Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

![Transfer Photos from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg)

At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

![Transfer Photos from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg)

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also, both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm the completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

Now, we’ll discuss how to transfer contacts from one Android to another with the help of a SIM card.

## Part 2: How to transfer contacts from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices using SIM card?

Here are the steps which will help you.

- To copy the contacts to your SIM card, you should follow the sequence –
- Go to “contact” on your old device.
- Then tap on “More” and then choose “settings”.

Now, pull the SIM card out and insert in on your new device.

• Here follow the same steps above and on “Import / Export” option, choose “Import”. Then it will ask for the option to import from. Choose “SIM Card” here. Now, all your contacts will be imported to your phone memory from the SIM card.

Advantages: This process is easy to use and can be done without any PC.

Disadvantage: It can only transfer the contacts up to the SIM capacity that is 200 to 250 in one time. If you have lots of contacts, it is impossible to transfer by this method.

## Part 3: How to transfer contacts from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct?

To transfer contacts from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct is one of the easiest methods. For this method, make sure that you should enable “Bluetooth” or “Wi-Fi Direct” on both the Android devices.

## Part 4: How to transfer contacts from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices using Samsung Smart Switch?

Samsung launched a new app called “Smart Switch” to allow transfer of content between Android devices. Although, it does not support allAndroid devices.

To transfer contacts from Motorola Moto G84 5G to Other Android Devices via this app, follow the below method step by step.

1\. First of all, download the app on both the mobiles.
