## Part 2: Transfer SMS from Xiaomi 13T to iPhone using Move to iOS app

Transferring text messages from Xiaomi 13T to iPhone using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer is the best and the fastest way. But it requires a computer and physically connecting the Xiaomi 13T devices via USB cables. What if the person doesn’t have a computer? They won’t be able to transfer any data from their old Android to a new iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max). If you want to find another way to transfer messages and other stuff from Xiaomi 13T to iPhone, then Move to the iOS app can help in this task.

Move to iOS is an Android app developed to make it easier to transfer data from Xiaomi 13T to iOS devices. It is available for free at Google Play Store and is of the minuscule size of approximately 2.2 MB. One doesn’t need to wait extreme time to install the app. With Move to iOS, you will be able to set up the iOS device easily without needing to connect it with a USB cable. But there are some prerequisites that you have to fulfill before you can transfer data from Xiaomi 13T to iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) or an earlier model-

- • The iPhone must have iOS 9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17
- • iPhone 5 or later is required
- • Android 4.0 and above
- • The iPhone hasn’t been set up yet or the data has been erased

### How to transfer text messages from Android and iPhone using Move to iOS?

Want to learn how to transfer messages from android to iPhone without USB cables and computers? With the below steps, you can easily transfer messages and other data from Xiaomi 13T to iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) using Move to iOS -

Step 1: Click on the “Move Data from Android” button on the “Apps and Data” screen during the iPhone setup process. If you have already set up the Xiaomi 13T device, then you need to erase the data from Settings > General > Reset and then go to Apps and Data screen.

![transfer messages from android to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/move-data-from-android.JPG "Apps and data screen")

Step 2: On the iPhone, click “Continue” on the Move from Android screen. It will generate the 6-digit or 10-digit code.

Step 3: Now on the Android device, download and install the Move to iOS app and open it.

Step 4: Tap on “Continue” and then “Agree” on the terms and conditions screen and then “Next” on the “Find Your Code” screen.

Step 5: Enter the code generated on the iPhone in the “Enter Code” screen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 6: On the Transfer Data screen, select the content to transfer and click “Next”. It will start the transfer process and will take some time to complete depending on the size of the data.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 7: After transferring is complete, finish the iPhone device setup process.

The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from Xiaomi 13T to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method. They can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) for the task.
