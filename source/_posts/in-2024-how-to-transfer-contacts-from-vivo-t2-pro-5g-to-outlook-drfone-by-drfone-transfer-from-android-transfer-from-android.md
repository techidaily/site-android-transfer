2. Now, you need to connect two devices to the system. Once the Vivo T2 Pro 5G devices are detected, authenticate them and select the media transfer option.
3. Both of your devices will automatically be detected by the application. Ideally, your Vivo T2 Pro 5G will be listed as “Source” while the iPhone should be the “Destination” device. If not, you can click on the Flip button to interchange their positions.

That’s it! With just one click, you can now move music from Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iPhone. After that, you can safely disconnect both of the Vivo T2 Pro 5G devices.

## Part 2: How to transfer music from Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iPhone selectively?

Another user-friendly way to learn how to send music from Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iPhone is by using [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html). A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit, it can be a complete Android device manager. You can transfer your data between Android and computer and from an Android to an iOS device. You can even move songs from your Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iTunes without using iTunes itself.
