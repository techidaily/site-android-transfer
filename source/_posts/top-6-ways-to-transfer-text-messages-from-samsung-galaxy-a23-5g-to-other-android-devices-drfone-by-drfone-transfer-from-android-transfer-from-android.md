Apple's ecosystem may be renowned for its exclusivity, but with the right methods, you can seamlessly bridge the gap between your iPod and an Android device.

One of the most straightforward ways to transfer music from your iPod to an Android device is by using Bluetooth.

Search for available Bluetooth devices on your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G, and select your iPod from the list. Likewise, confirm the pairing request on your iPod.
