**Important Note:** New Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has new software to transfer all files to another device, called Smart switch. This feature is used for keeping the backup and restoring the files. Though it is good software, it has many cons. So, before using that app, check these cons.

- After transferring the data, the smart switch does not back up the data. It is quite hard to recover the data using this app.
- Using the Smart Switch app, you can only transfer the data from Samsung to Samsung. You can't use it for other devices.
