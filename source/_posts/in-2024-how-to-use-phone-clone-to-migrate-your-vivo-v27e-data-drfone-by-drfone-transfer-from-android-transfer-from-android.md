Here’s how to pair your old and new phone together via Bluetooth:

Step 1: On your old and new devices, go to Settings, then Bluetooth

Step 2: Make sure Bluetooth is “On” on both of them

Step 3: If everything is done correctly, both devices will show themselves to each other

Step 4: Tap the other device on either of them. Here, the Moto G4 Play was tapped on OnePlus Nord 2:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 5: A prompt to pair with the new phone will come on the other device as well. For your device, make sure that the PIN is the same on both devices to ensure the security of the connection. This PIN is generated afresh and is unique, so the PIN in the image is not the PIN you will see on your devices. Tap Pair on your old device to pair the two devices together using Bluetooth.

Step 6: After pairing is complete, both devices will show under paired devices on each other:

### I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth

Here is how to transfer contacts from one Android to another, easily, using Bluetooth:

Step 1: Go to Phone on your old phone and select the Contacts tab

Step 2: Tap the vertical ellipses and select Import/ Export.

![export contacts from old android to new](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-4.jpg)

This particular option can vary by your phone model and Android flavor, this is on Android 7 running on Motorola G4 Play. If you are unable to find a way to select contacts or share contacts in the Phone app on your phone, use the Contacts app on your phone for the same effect.

Step 3: A popup will emerge:

![select share all contacts to transfer contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Select Share All Contacts.

Step 4: When you do that, this will come up:

![select bluetooth as the method to share with](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-6.jpg)

Select Bluetooth in the Share With menu. You may select Always or Just Once and proceed.

Step 5: Choose the paired handset, in this case, the OnePlus Nord 2:

![select paired device to transfer to](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-7.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 6: The VCF file will be exported to Nord 2 and you can accept it on the Nord 2 (new device).

And that is how to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth!

## Part II: Other Methods to Transfer Contacts from Vivo V27e to Other Android Devices

What are other ways to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another? Glad you asked. Because there are other ways to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another that do not use Bluetooth and can be both seamless and more powerful than the Bluetooth method, depending on your tastes and needs.

### II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account

This is another method to transfer your contacts on one Android device and restore them on another Android device. Here’s how to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Google Sync:

Step 1: Go to Settings on your old device

Step 2: Tap Accounts

Step 3: Tap the account you want to transfer contacts from

Step 4: Make sure that there is a checkmark next to Contacts, or, in other words, Contacts sync is enabled/ toggled.

### II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps

Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Vivo V27e to iOS.

There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.

Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device

Step 2: Keep the Vivo V27e devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Vivo V27e devices are in different rooms or too far away.

Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Vivo V27e devices

Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android

Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device

Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices

Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.

Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.

Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.

That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.

**Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods**

It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.

In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Vivo V27e devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.

Step 4: When the Vivo V27e devices are connected, select the Contacts category to transfer and click Start Transfer. Within seconds, your contacts will be transferred to the new device.

![transfer complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-5.png)

Transferring contacts from one Android to another Android can be done in two broad ways. One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Vivo V27e to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.
