Another method for **HTC U23 to iPhone transfer** is using Cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Both Dropbox and Google Drive serve as virtual storage spaces accessible from any device with an internet connection. Users can upload and store their files to the cloud, making them available for download on other devices.

Either Google Drive or Dropbox follows similar steps for data transfer. The difference between them is in the amount of free storage each service provides. Notably, Google Drive provides 15GB of free storage, while Dropbox offers 2GB.

Follow these steps on how to do a HTC U23 to iPhone transfer via cloud storage services.

- **Step 1:** Install and set up Dropbox/Google Drive:

Begin by installing the Dropbox or Google Drive app on both your HTC U23 and iPhone. Create accounts if you don't have them already.

- **Step 2:** Upload the files from HTC U23

Open the cloud storage app on your HTC U23 device and upload the data you want to transfer. This can include photos, videos, documents, and more. Then, wait for the upload to complete. Make sure that all files are successfully uploaded before proceeding.

- **Step 3:** Sign in to the cloud storage on your iPhone

On your iPhone, open Dropbox or Google Drive and sign in with the same account. Find the transferred files in the cloud storage.

- **Step 4:** Download to iPhone:

Select the files you want to transfer and download them to your iPhone. Once the download is complete, organize the transferred files on your iPhone as needed.
