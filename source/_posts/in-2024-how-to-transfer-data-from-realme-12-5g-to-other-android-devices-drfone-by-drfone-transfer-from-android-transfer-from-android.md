## Part 3. How to Do Realme 12 5G to iPhone Data Transfer Using Dropbox/Google Drive

Another method for **Realme 12 5G to iPhone transfer** is using Cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Both Dropbox and Google Drive serve as virtual storage spaces accessible from any device with an internet connection. Users can upload and store their files to the cloud, making them available for download on other devices.

Either Google Drive or Dropbox follows similar steps for data transfer. The difference between them is in the amount of free storage each service provides. Notably, Google Drive provides 15GB of free storage, while Dropbox offers 2GB.

Follow these steps on how to do a Realme 12 5G to iPhone transfer via cloud storage services.

- **Step 1:** Install and set up Dropbox/Google Drive:

Begin by installing the Dropbox or Google Drive app on both your Realme 12 5G and iPhone. Create accounts if you don't have them already.

- **Step 2:** Upload the files from Realme 12 5G

Open the cloud storage app on your Realme 12 5G device and upload the data you want to transfer. This can include photos, videos, documents, and more. Then, wait for the upload to complete. Make sure that all files are successfully uploaded before proceeding.

- **Step 3:** Sign in to the cloud storage on your iPhone

On your iPhone, open Dropbox or Google Drive and sign in with the same account. Find the transferred files in the cloud storage.

## Conclusion

Transitioning from a Realme 12 5G device to an iPhone, or vice versa, may present challenges due to the difference in operating systems. However, with the right tools and methods, the **iPhone to Realme 12 5G data transfer** can be done seamlessly and efficiently.

Even though Realme 12 5G Migrate is no longer in the game, apps like ShareIt and Move to iOS can be alternatives for a direct transfer.

And for those who prefer the cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive also offer a solution. So, no matter your preference, there's a solution to ensure your data transfer moves smoothly.
