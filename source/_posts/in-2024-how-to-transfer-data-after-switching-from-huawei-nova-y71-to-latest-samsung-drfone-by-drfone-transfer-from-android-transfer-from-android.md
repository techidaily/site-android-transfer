### 2\. Move Data From Huawei Nova Y71 to Samsung Using Smart Switch

Samsung’s Smart Switch app is excellent for moving data (even settings) between Android devices. However, you can only transfer settings, memos (including voice), and app data between Galaxy phones.

Also, you can’t transfer apps you haven’t downloaded from the Play Store or encrypted data like WhatsApp chats. Wondershare Dr.Fone is better if you don’t want to lose your IM conversations.

Here’s how to move data from Huawei Nova Y71 to Samsung S23 with Smart Switch:

1. Download and install Smart Switch on both phones and place them next to one another.
2. Get your Samsung S23 and go to **Settings > Accounts and backup > Bring data from an old device**.

![samsung smart switch options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-3.jpg)

3. On your Samsung S23, tap **Receive data**and choose **Galaxy/Android** as the source.

![android to samsung data transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-4.jpg)

4. Tap **Send data**on your old phone and select **Wireless** (it’s faster than a cable connection). Tap **Allow** to enable data access.

![establishing a wireless connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-5.jpg)

5. Choose the desired data using your Samsung S23, tap **Transfer**, then **Go to the Home screen**once everything is on your new phone.

![moving data with smart switch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-6.jpg)

Remember to charge both phones before transferring data or connect them to a power source to ensure the process goes smoothly.

### 3\. Transfer Data Using Google Account Sync

Backing up your Google Account data with Google One means accessing it on any device upon login. The backup includes apps, phone settings, messages, calls, photos, videos, and your chosen Google Account data (e.g., contacts, calendar, emails, and documents).

Here’s how to transfer data to Samsung Galaxy S23 using Google Account synchronization:

1. Go to **Settings > Google > Backup > Google Account data**on your old Android phone and toggle on the desired switches for synchronization.

![transferring google account data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-7.jpg)

2. On your Samsung S23, go to **Settings > Google**and log into your backed-up Google Account.

Everything you’ve previously backed up will automatically sync once you log into your Google Account.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Share Data via Bluetooth

Bluetooth may be slower than most data-sharing methods, but its reliability is why we never have to imagine life without it. It may not support transferring settings or downloaded apps, but it’s excellent for moving all your photos, videos, music, and other files.

Here’s how to share data between Android and Samsung S23 via Bluetooth:

1. Go to **Settings > Connections**and toggle on the **Bluetooth** switch on both phones. Alternatively, use a shortcut in the **Notification panel**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![turning on bluetooth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-8.jpg)

3. Tap **Share > Bluetooth**and choose your new phone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![transferring data via bluetooth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-9.jpg)

Sharing data via Bluetooth may take a while, but this valuable feature will bring everything you need to your new smartphone.

### 5\. Use Google Drive

Google Drive is a prominent cloud storage and file-sharing platform. You’re missing out if you don’t use it. It lets you synchronize data across devices, access files in the cloud, and create presentation slides, spreadsheets, forms, and documents (online and offline).

Transferring data from Huawei Nova Y71 to Samsung S23 is seamless with Google Drive. Here’s what to do:

1. Launch Google Drive on your old Android and tap **New > Upload**. The **New**button features only a **plus sign** on some devices.

![uploading data to google drive](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-10.jpg)

2. Add all folders or files you wish to transfer to your new phone.
3. Open Google Drive on your Samsung S23 and sign into the correct account.
4. Select the uploaded data, tap the **kebab menu**(the three vertical dots in the top right corner), and hit **Download**.

![downloading data from google drive](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-11.jpg)

Google Drive may limit you to 15 GB of free storage, but it’s among the best Google apps for sharing files across devices. You may already use its desktop version to collaborate on docs and spreadsheets, so why not leverage its handy mobile app?

### 6\. Transfer Data Using a USB Cable

USB cables—the unsung heroes of connectivity. Like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, we can’t imagine life without them. They’re perfect for transferring data between devices.

However, in this instance, we don’t mean the traditional data transfer between your phone and computer (we’ll get to that shortly). This trick involves connecting your old Android phone to your new Samsung Galaxy S23 with a USB cable.

It’s almost like Samsung’s Smart Switch, except you don’t need to download an app and can move more data. You can transfer everything from your old Android device’s internal storage to your new smartphone. Here’s how:

1. Connect your phones using a USB-C to USB-C cable. Your Samsung Galaxy S23 came with it.

![connecting phones with a usb cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-12.jpg)

2. Tap **Connected to Android**on your Galaxy S23 phone and select **MTP Host** (Media Transfer Protocol).

<a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![transferring data to samsung s23](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-17.jpg)

Moving data between phones using a USB cable is faster than Bluetooth but offers the same functionality. However, charge your devices beforehand because the data transfer may take a while (if you have many sizable files).

### 7\. Use an SD Card

We can almost see you fumbling with your Samsung S23, looking for an SD or microSD card slot. Newsflash: there isn’t one. Like its predecessors, S21 and S22, the Galaxy S23 series doesn’t support expandable storage.

How can you transfer data from an SD card, then? Well, there’s always your computer. You can migrate your SD card data to your desktop or laptop before moving it to your new Galaxy phone.

It may not be as straightforward as the methods above, but it’s ideal for keeping precious files from your old Android’s SD card. Here’s what to do:

1. Select the desired files or folders on your old Android, tap **Move**, and choose your **SD card**.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115" border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![moving files to an sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-18.jpg)

2. Connect the Android to your computer with a USB cable.
3. Tap **USB for file transfer**in the **Notification panel** and select **Transferring files / Android Auto**.

![choosing a usb for file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-19.jpg)

4. Go to **This PC**in **File Explorer** and open your phone under **Devices and drives**.
5. Right-click the folders or files you wish to move, select **Copy**, and paste them to any location on your computer.

![transferring files to a pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-20.jpg)

6. Once you move the data, safely disconnect your old Android and connect your Samsung S23 to the PC.
7. Go to the folder with your newly saved data and copy-paste it to your Samsung S23.

This method is best for transferring photos, videos, and other files from an SD card you might not use anymore. After all, smartphone manufacturers increasingly ditch SD card slots for sleek, more compact designs.

## Conclusion

Switching from Huawei Nova Y71 to Samsung S23 is a breeze because you have many data transfer options. Besides Samsung’s Smart Switch, you can use your synced Google Account, Google Drive, Bluetooth, or a USB-C to USB-C cable. You can also migrate data from your old Android SD card to your computer before transferring it to your new phone.

However, Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer might be your best option. Besides transferring files, it features many tools for seamless phone management, making it a fantastic addition to your digital toolbox.

## Transfer Files to Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro via PC

Using a computer as an intermediary device for transferring files is another excellent idea, and it’ll even let you organize your old phone’s data before you copy it to your new device.

1. Connect your old Samsung device to your PC via USB.
2. Tap the phone’s notification and select **File Transfer**under the “Use USB for” option.
3. Access its memory through the computer’s File Explorer.
4. Select the files and folders you want to copy and transfer them to a new folder on your PC. You can then go through these files on your PC, delete what you don’t need, and organize everything before transferring the data to your new Pixel 8 device, but this is optional.

8. Transfer the contents of your computer’s folder onto the new device.

You’ll need to consider which types of files go into which folders. For example, you’ll need to ensure that music data goes into Android’s Music folder, pictures and videos go into Camera or DCIM folders, and documents and downloads have their respective folders, which are typical on Android.

## Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch

Another excellent option for transferring files to any Pixel phone is with Google’s Quick Switch adapters. These free OTG devices are included in every Pixel phone box and are designed to help you transfer data from an old phone to a new Pixel device.

A Quick Switch adapter connects to your Pixel phone, and you can insert a Samsung-compatible USB cable on the other end to start the transfer process.

Here’s what you’ll need to do:

1. Power on your new Pixel 8/8 Pro phone and click **Start**.
2. Plug the Quick Switch adapter into the Pixel device and connect the USB cable with the USB-A end into the Quick Switch. Connect the other end to the Samsung phone.
3. Unlock your Samsung device and click the **Copy**

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Pixel Using Google Drive

Being an Android user requires a Google account, granting you access to 15 GB of free storage space on Google Drive, making the app an excellent way to transfer files from your old phone to your new one. Here’s how you can use it:

1. Using your old Samsung phone, navigate to **Settings**\> **Accounts and Backup**\> **Back up data** under **Google Drive**.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.

To help you out, we’ve prepared the top seven methods for handling data transfers from Samsung to Google Pixel, which include the built-in data transfer tool during device setup, USB cables, Quick Switch adapter, Google Drive, email, and a dedicated third-party app – Wondershare Dr.Fone.
