However, most of the latest Honor X50 GT models are now unable to run Honor X50 GT Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015.

ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Honor X50 GT and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Honor X50 GT and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Honor X50 GT device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Honor X50 GT device will initiate a search for nearby devices.
