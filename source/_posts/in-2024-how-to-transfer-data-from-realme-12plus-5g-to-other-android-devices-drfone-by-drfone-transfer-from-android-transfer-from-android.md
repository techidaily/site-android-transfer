Nevertheless, you will need to find a solution to these problems to transfer your data successfully from android to iOS devices. This section will discuss possible solutions to the errors that occasionally appear when moving android data to iOS devices.

### Tip 1: Restart both your devices

Restarting your devices is the essential thing to do when troubleshooting the Move to iOS problems. It is a great way o eliminate minor issues during data transfer from android to iOS devices. The process can resolve the Move to iOS stuck on connecting to iPhone issues. A simple restart will eliminate the bugs and any cached error in the Realme 12+ 5G devices.

### Tip 2: Clear all running apps

It is recommended to avoid using the android device o run applications when using the Move to iOS app. Since the app runs in the foreground, you should ensure all other apps in the android are disabled before starting the data transfer process. Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.

### Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on

Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone's private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.

### Tip 4: Plug both devices to power

You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Realme 12+ 5G devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.

### Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode

When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.

The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.

### Tip 6: Check the storage requirement

Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don't need to transfer from your android device before getting started.

### Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer

Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.

### Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices

You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store. Generally, the app runs on Android 4.0 and above while transferring data to iOS 9.0 or later devices.

### Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization

Turning off the battery optimization on both your Android and iOS device is a requirement when using the Move to iOS tool. The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode.
