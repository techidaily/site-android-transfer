## Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Oppo A78 5G to iPad/iPhone

Transferring photos from your Oppo A78 5G to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it's essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won't make the same errors.

**1\. Insufficient battery levels**

Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad/iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.

**2\. Limited storage space**

Overlooking available storage space on the iPad/iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad/iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.

**3\. Interference from Third-Party Apps:**

Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.

**4\. Ignoring file compatibility:**

Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.

**5\. Skipping App Permissions:**

When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it's common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.

**Step 2: Assign Correct Positions to Motorola and Samsung Devices**

Now, you need to assign the Motorola and Samsung devices to their respective positions. Here, the Motorola phone should be in the "Source" position. In the same way, the Samsung device needs to be in the "Destination" position. Use the "Flip" button in case the assigned positions are incorrect.

## Part 3. Using Official Tools to Transfer Data from Motorola to Samsung

Samsung Smart Switch is an official tool developed by Samsung. This tool is designed to simplify transferring data from an old device, including non-Samsung devices like Motorola, to a new Samsung smartphone or tablet. This tool supports various data types, such as contacts, photos, messages, videos, calendars, and music. You can use the steps given below to transfer your data from Motorola to Samsung using Smart Switch:

**Step 1.** Begin with ensuring the Smart Switch app is installed on both devices. It comes pre-installed on Samsung devices, and you can download it from the Google Play Store for Motorola. Now, launch the app on both devices and keep both devices near each other.
