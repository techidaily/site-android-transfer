## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Vivo Y100t to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Vivo Y100t Migrate if you are a Vivo Y100t user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Vivo Y100t devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Vivo Y100t device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Vivo Y100t models are now unable to run Vivo Y100t Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Vivo Y100t to iPhone besides Vivo Y100t Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Vivo Y100t Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Vivo Y100t to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Vivo Y100t and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Vivo Y100t and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Vivo Y100t device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Vivo Y100t device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Vivo Y100t device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Vivo Y100t phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.
