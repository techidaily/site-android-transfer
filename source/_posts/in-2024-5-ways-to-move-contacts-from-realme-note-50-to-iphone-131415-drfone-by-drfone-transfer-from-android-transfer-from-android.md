### Step 2: Connect Android and iOS Device

Next, you can connect your Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and an iOS device to the computer (you can also use an Android device here). Use a USB cable for the Android device and a lightning cable for the iOS device. You'll get an interface like below when the program detects both devices. You can use the "Flip" button to change devices as the target device and the sender device. You can also choose the file types here to transfer.

### Step 3: Start Transfer Process

After choosing the desired file types (Photos for this case), click on the "Start Transfer" button to start the transfer process. Keep patience until the process ends and make sure both Android and iOS devices stay connected properly during the process.

**Important Note:** New Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has new software to transfer all files to another device, called Smart switch. This feature is used for keeping the backup and restoring the files. Though it is good software, it has many cons. So, before using that app, check these cons.

- Smart Switch has a low-speed transfer problem. It shows up when you transfer data with wireless connectivity.
- After transferring the data, the smart switch does not back up the data. It is quite hard to recover the data using this app.
- Using the Smart Switch app, you can only transfer the data from Samsung to Samsung. You can't use it for other devices.

### Conclusion

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has amazing features for the bottom line and is more updated than other models. It has the best quality camera, better battery capacity, and other new features. The design and the display are way better than the other models. After purchasing the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, if you get stuck transferring your photos to the Realme Note 50 device, then you don't have to worry. We have introduced you to Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer in this article. Using this software, you can recover any files and keep data backup and restore them later. To transfer your photos to Galaxy S21 Ultra, you can use Dr.Fone Switch app by following the steps we provided. It's definitely better software than Smart Switch.
