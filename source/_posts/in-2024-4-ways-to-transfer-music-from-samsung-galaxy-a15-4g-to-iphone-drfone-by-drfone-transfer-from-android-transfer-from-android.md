That’s it! With just one click, you can now move music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone. After that, you can safely disconnect both of the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G devices.

## Part 2: How to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone selectively?

Another user-friendly way to learn how to send music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone is by using [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html). A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit, it can be a complete Android device manager. You can transfer your data between Android and computer and from an Android to an iOS device. You can even move songs from your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iTunes without using iTunes itself.



### [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html "iphone transfer")

Transfer Media from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone/iTunes

- Transfer contacts, music, messages, and more data between Android and computer.

- Transfer your data between iTunes & Android.
- Manage the data on your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G on a computer.

Since it is a complete Android phone manager, you can use it to transfer all the other kinds of data (like photos, videos, contacts, messages, and more) from one source to another. Unlike Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer that moves all the music files at once, you can perform a selective data transfer. The interface will provide a preview of your data so that you can choose the files you wish to move. To learn how to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

2. Connect both Android phones and iPhone to software and let them be detected automatically. From the top-left option, make sure you have selected your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G as a default/source device. The interface will provide its snapshot with some shortcuts.

4. Choose the files and then select the export button on the toolbar. From here, select the connected iPhone as a source.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on the export icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/android-transfer-export-music-01.jpg)

5. Wait a moment and let the application automatically transfer your selected music files from your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to your iPhone.

    Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iTunes as well. To do this, you need to select the “Transfer Device Media to iTunes” option from its home page. This will launch a pop-up window and let you move your music files from the Android device to iTunes directly.

In this way, you can selectively transfer music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone in a hassle-free manner.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to your system. Though, to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).
3. Go to the Music folder, copy your favorite songs, and save them to your Mac. After that, you can transfer music from your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to your Mac.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iPhone-Go to the Music folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg)

4. Great! You are halfway there. Launch iTunes on your Mac and add the newly transferred music to it. You can drag and drop it from the Finder to iTunes. Alternatively, you can also go to its options and click on “Add files to Library”. In this way, you can manually add new music to your iTunes library.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-Add files to Library](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-2.jpg)

5. Once you have transferred the newly added music to iTunes, connect your target iPhone to the system, and let iTunes detect it automatically.
6. Select your iPhone from the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G devices and go to its “Music” tab. From here, you can enable the “Sync Music” options. Select the playlists and songs you wish to move and click on the “Apply” button to initiate the process.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-Select the playlists and songs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-3.jpg)

Needless to say, the process is a bit complicated. Furthermore, you might face some compatibility issues between your devices and iTunes as well.

In this way, you can learn how to send music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone through iTunes and Android File Transfer.

## Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone?

These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them. The good thing about these streaming services is that you can access your music from multiple devices. For instance, let’s consider the example of Spotify.

Once you have created a playlist on your Spotify account, you can access it from any other device. You can even access your music by visiting its website because it will be stored on Spotify’s server and not your device itself.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-transfer streaming music](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-4.jpg)

If you are moving from an Android to an iPhone, you can follow these steps to ensure your Spotify music won’t be lost.

- Launch Spotify on your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G and go to the Playlist tab. From here, you can create a playlist. Later, you can add your favorite songs to this playlist as well. You can even create multiple playlists on the app.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-create a playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-5.jpg)

- Afterward, unlock your iPhone and go to the App store. Look for the music streaming app and download it on your phone.
- Once you log in to your Spotify account using your credentials, you can access “My Music” and access all your saved playlists.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-access all your saved playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg)

The same drill can be followed for all the other streaming services as well. While you can sync your music using these streaming services, the songs you have made available offline will not be listed here. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have saved them in a playlist beforehand.

When you know how to move music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone, you can easily make this transition. Go ahead and pick a preferred option to transfer music from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to iPhone. For a one-click transfer of data, you can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/), while to make a selective transfer, you can try [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html). Both of these are user-friendly and reliable tools that will come handy to you on numerous occasions.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.
