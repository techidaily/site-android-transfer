## Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Vivo S18 to iPad/iPhone

Transferring photos from your Vivo S18 to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it's essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won't make the same errors.

**1\. Insufficient battery levels**

Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad/iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.

**2\. Limited storage space**

Overlooking available storage space on the iPad/iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad/iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.

**3\. Interference from Third-Party Apps:**

Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.

**4\. Ignoring file compatibility:**

Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.

**5\. Skipping App Permissions:**

When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it's common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.

Wondershare Dr.Fone also features other helpful tools, such as the De-Duplicate option, which automatically scans all your contacts for any repetitions, which is always a nuisance (you often end up with duplicate contacts if you sync your contacts with Facebook, as well as already having them on your device, for example).

## Mobogenie Android USB File Transfer

**Advantages:**

- Uninstall stock apps in batches.
- Easy-to-use interface.
- Easily download and manage apps.
- Easily transfer multiple files from your PC to your Android, and vice versa.
- Free of charge.

**Disadvantages:**

- USB only.
- Only connect one Android device at a time.
- Does not have integrated music sharing.

**Overview:**

Download Mobogenie and run it, and connect your Vivo S18 to the computer. Once your device has been connected, you will be prompted to install the driver for your device so that the application is automatically downloaded onto it. Once you have completed this process, you will be taken to the home screen:

![bluetooth android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/moborobo-home.jpg)

As with other data management software, you can download and install apps onto your Vivo S18 from your PC. The advantage of this is that apps can be downloaded quickly, and also without costing you in terms of data roaming charges.

![usb android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/download-app-with-mobogenie.jpg)

A neat feature is the ability to uninstall apps that came preloaded on the phone as often we find ourselves with apps that we never use that we cannot delete.

![use transfer android file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/uninstall-app-with-mobogenie.jpg)

The transfer of photo files is straightforward, and several photos can be selected from your computer to import onto your device at once, or vice versa.

![usb to android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/transfer-photos-with-mobogenie.jpg)

**Features:**

- Free.
- Support wireless connection of devices on the same network (although temperamental).
- Support multiple devices.
- Download apps onto it through app store.
- Simple to use.

**Overview:**

Download MoboRobo and install this Android USB file transfer tool on your computer. Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your Vivo S18 with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your Vivo S18 as well.

Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.

![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Vivo S18 with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
