![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Tecno Spark Go (2023) with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
