**Step 2: Assign Correct Positions to Motorola and Samsung Devices**

Now, you need to assign the Motorola and Samsung devices to their respective positions. Here, the Motorola phone should be in the "Source" position. In the same way, the Samsung device needs to be in the "Destination" position. Use the "Flip" button in case the assigned positions are incorrect.
