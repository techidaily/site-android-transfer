For those looking to transfer music from an Android device to an iPod, the Move to iOS app provides a user-friendly solution.

**Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions

Open Move to iOS on your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

**Step 3:** Enter the Code

On your iPod, a six to ten-digit code will be displayed. Enter this code when prompted on your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition.

**Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer

In the Move to iOS app, choose "Music" to transfer your music files specifically. Then, tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

**Step 5:** Transfer complete.

Allow the app to complete the transfer process. Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPod. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process.
