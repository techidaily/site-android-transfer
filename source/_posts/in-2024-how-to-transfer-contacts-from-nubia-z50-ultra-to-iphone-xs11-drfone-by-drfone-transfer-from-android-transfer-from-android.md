However, most of the latest Nubia Z50 Ultra models are now unable to run Nubia Z50 Ultra Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Nubia Z50 Ultra to iPhone besides Nubia Z50 Ultra Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Nubia Z50 Ultra Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Nubia Z50 Ultra to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Nubia Z50 Ultra and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Nubia Z50 Ultra and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Nubia Z50 Ultra device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Nubia Z50 Ultra device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Nubia Z50 Ultra device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Nubia Z50 Ultra phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Nubia Z50 Ultra to iPhone via Apps & Data

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Nubia Z50 Ultra phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

- **Step 5:** Transfer complete.
