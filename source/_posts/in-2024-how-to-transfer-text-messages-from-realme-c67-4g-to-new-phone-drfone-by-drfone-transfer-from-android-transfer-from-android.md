In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Realme C67 4G to iPhone besides Realme C67 4G Migrate.

On your Realme C67 4G device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
