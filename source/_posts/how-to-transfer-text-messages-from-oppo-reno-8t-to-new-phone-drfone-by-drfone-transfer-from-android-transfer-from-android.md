The next step is to take your Oppo Reno 8T to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.

- **Step 2:** Switch to your Oppo Reno 8T, open the Google Play Store, and search for the ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- **Step 3:** Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.
