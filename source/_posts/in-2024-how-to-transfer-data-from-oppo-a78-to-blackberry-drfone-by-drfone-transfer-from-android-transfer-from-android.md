### Method 3: Google Drive \[Cloud Storages\]

Cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive provide a practical and effective method. This process enables effortless video transfer between an Android device and an iPad. Google Drive functions as a hub for storing, sharing, and accessing files among diverse internet-connected devices.

Nevertheless, a drawback to this method is the restricted complimentary storage space of 15GB offered by Google Drive. Below are the outlined steps to execute the process to **transfer videos from Oppo A78 to iPad**:

- **Step 1.** First, download and install the Google Drive app on your Android and sign in using your Google account. Tap the "+ New" button, select "Upload" within the app, and pick the videos you want from your device's storage.

Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Oppo A78 and copy or move the desired videos from your Oppo A78 to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Oppo A78.
