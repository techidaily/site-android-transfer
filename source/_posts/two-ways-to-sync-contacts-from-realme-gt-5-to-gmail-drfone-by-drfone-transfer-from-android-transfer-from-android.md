_I would like to export/edit my contacts that are on My Realme GT 5 and get them onto my computer for a back, to edit them, to input/import them into Outlook. Can this be done and how? Is there something I can download or a backup assistant?_

With lots of contacts on your Realme GT 5, you may want to transfer these contacts from Realme GT 5 to Outlook for backup. This way, when you get a new Android phone or when you lose contacts by accident, you can quickly get them back.

To sync Android to Outlook, I highly recommend an Android manager: [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html). This program empowers you to transfer contacts on your Realme GT 5 to Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013 easily and effortlessly.

### Step 2. Android to Outlook sync

Then, click "Contacts" under "Information" panel on the top. In the contact management window, choose the contacts that you want to export. Click "Export" button. When the drop-down menu pops up, you can either click "Export selected contacts to computer" or "Export all contacts to computer". After that, click "to Outlook Express" or "to Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013". Then, the contract transferring begins. Be sure your Realme GT 5 is connected all the time.

As you see, apart from exporting Android contacts to Outlook, you can also copy contacts from Realme GT 5 to vCard, Windows Live Mail and Windows Address Book. If you have a Gmail account, you’re able to export Android contacts to your computer, and then backup these Android contacts to your Gmail account too.
