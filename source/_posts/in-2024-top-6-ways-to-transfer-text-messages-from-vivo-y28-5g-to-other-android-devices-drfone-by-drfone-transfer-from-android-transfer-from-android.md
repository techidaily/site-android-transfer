## Part 3: How to transfer music from Vivo Y28 5G to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Vivo Y28 5G to your system. Though, to transfer music from Vivo Y28 5G to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Vivo Y28 5G to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).
3. Go to the Music folder, copy your favorite songs, and save them to your Mac. After that, you can transfer music from your Vivo Y28 5G to your Mac.

### Method 2: iTunes

Using iTunes to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad involves a slightly indirect process. The variance in operating systems is the primary reason for this distinction. iTunes is primarily tailored for iOS devices; however, with supplemental steps, it can be utilized to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad. Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Vivo Y28 5G and copy or move the desired videos from your Vivo Y28 5G to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Vivo Y28 5G.

- **Step 2.** Access the "File" menu and choose either "Add File to Library" or "Add Folder to Library." Proceed by locating and selecting the transferred videos to import them into your iTunes library.

- **Step 3.** Connect your computer to the iPad using a USB cable to enable iTunes recognition of your iPad. Click on the iPad icon positioned at the top-left corner of iTunes. Next, navigate to the "Movies" tab located in the left sidebar to continue the process.
