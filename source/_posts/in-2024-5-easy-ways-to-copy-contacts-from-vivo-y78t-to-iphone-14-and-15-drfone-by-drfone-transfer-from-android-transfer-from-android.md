### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Vivo Y78t device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer.
