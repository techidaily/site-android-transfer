## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo K11x devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Oppo K11x, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Oppo K11x to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Oppo K11x to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Oppo K11x, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.
