If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Infinix Note 30 VIP to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Infinix Note 30 VIP to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Infinix Note 30 VIP Migrate if you are a Infinix Note 30 VIP user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Infinix Note 30 VIP devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Infinix Note 30 VIP device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Infinix Note 30 VIP models are now unable to run Infinix Note 30 VIP Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Infinix Note 30 VIP to iPhone besides Infinix Note 30 VIP Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Infinix Note 30 VIP Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Infinix Note 30 VIP to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Infinix Note 30 VIP and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Infinix Note 30 VIP and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Infinix Note 30 VIP device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Infinix Note 30 VIP device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Infinix Note 30 VIP device will initiate a search for nearby devices.
