- **Step 2: Define Source and Destination Positions**

Here, ensure that the Android device is on "Source" while the iPad is on the "Destination" position. Use the "Flip" switch if the positions are wrong. Now, choose the videos and other data you want to transfer and hit "Start Transfer." This will kickstart the transfer process of videos between devices.

### Method 2: iTunes

Using iTunes to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad involves a slightly indirect process. The variance in operating systems is the primary reason for this distinction. iTunes is primarily tailored for iOS devices; however, with supplemental steps, it can be utilized to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad. Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Samsung Galaxy S23+ and copy or move the desired videos from your Samsung Galaxy S23+ to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Samsung Galaxy S23+.

- **Step 2.** Access the "File" menu and choose either "Add File to Library" or "Add Folder to Library." Proceed by locating and selecting the transferred videos to import them into your iTunes library.

- **Step 3.** Connect your computer to the iPad using a USB cable to enable iTunes recognition of your iPad. Click on the iPad icon positioned at the top-left corner of iTunes. Next, navigate to the "Movies" tab located in the left sidebar to continue the process.
