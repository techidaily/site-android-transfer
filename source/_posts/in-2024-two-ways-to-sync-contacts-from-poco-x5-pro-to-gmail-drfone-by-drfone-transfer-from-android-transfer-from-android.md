2. Then tap on "Apps" or "Apps Manager," depending on your device and Android version.
3. Go to all Apps and find Contact Sync.
4. Select Clear Cache and also Clear Data.

6. Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting "Contacts to Display", then "All Contacts"
7. This should make all the contacts on your device to appear, and your sync problem should also be solved.

These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account.

Also, keep in mind that it might take a longer period of time for the contacts to synchronize to Google on a slower network connection, in deviance to a fast network connection, so you might need to exercise some patience if you're on a slower Internet connection.

However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts.

## Can I Transfer iPod Music to Android?

**Can you transfer music from an iPod to an Android phone**? Despite the fact that the iPod is an Apple product, transferring its music to an Android device is indeed possible. Apple's ecosystem may be renowned for its exclusivity, but with the right methods, you can seamlessly bridge the gap between your iPod and an Android device.

One of the most straightforward ways to transfer music from your iPod to an Android device is by using Bluetooth. It's worth noting that Bluetooth transfer capability is present in all iPod Touch models but not in older iPod models. Bluetooth support for iPod Touch was introduced with the 2nd Generation and iOS 3.0, while iPod Nano gained support from the 7th Generation onward.

Alternatively, other methods involve employing a dedicated app and third-party software as an intermediary. Rest assured; the upcoming sections will comprehensively cover these approaches, providing you with the necessary guidance for a smooth music transfer process.

## Part 1. Transfer Music from iPod to Android via Bluetooth

Bluetooth technology serves as a versatile means for wirelessly connecting devices, and in this case, it provides a convenient avenue for transferring music from your iPod to an Android device. This wireless approach simplifies the process, allowing for seamless data exchange between the two devices.

But first, you still need to check Bluetooth compatibility. Ensure that both your iPod and Android devices can do Bluetooth transfer. This method is also applicable when you wonder **how to download music from an iPod to an Android phone**.

**Step 1:** Enable Bluetooth on both Devices.

On your iPod, navigate to the Settings menu and select Bluetooth. Enable Bluetooth on the Android device by accessing its settings as well. Make sure that you have set both devices to discoverable mode.

**Step 2:** Pair the Poco X5 Pro devices.

Search for available Bluetooth devices on your Poco X5 Pro, and select your iPod from the list. Likewise, confirm the pairing request on your iPod.

**Step 3**: Initiate file transfer.

Once paired, locate the music files on your iPod that you wish to transfer. Use the sharing or send via Bluetooth option (this may vary depending on your iPod model) to send the selected music files to your Poco X5 Pro.

**Step 4:** Accept the files on Android.

Accept the incoming Bluetooth transfer request from the iPod. The music files will then be transferred wirelessly from your iPod to the Android device.

**Step 5**: Verify transfer success.

Confirm the successful transfer by checking the music library on your Poco X5 Pro. The transferred songs should now be available and ready to play.

## Conclusion

Transferring music seamlessly between iPod and Android devices, and vice versa, has become more accessible than ever with the right tools and methods. Bluetooth technology serves as a wireless bridge, allowing users to effortlessly move their favourite music from an iPod to an Android device.

On the other hand, there are also apps like Move to iOS and [Dr.Fone Basic](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) that facilitate the transfer of music depending on your needs. These options empower users to break through the traditional barriers of device exclusivity and seamlessly enjoy their music collections across different ecosystems.
