### How to transfer Android messages to iPhone 12/XS (Max) using Move to iOS app

The first method to transfer text messages from Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to iPhone 12/XS (Max) is using the official Move to iOS app from Apple.

My Wi-Fi got some issues, and Move to iOS couldn’t properly complete the transfer.

**Guide for Move to iOS** **to transfer messages from Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to iPhone 12/XS (Max)**

1. Download, install, and launch Move to iOS on your Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G.
2. Get the iPhone 12/XS (Max) and configure the setup and then connect to Wi-Fi. Browse to the ‘Apps & Data’ option, click ‘Move Data from Android’ thereafter. Click the ‘Continue’ button and note the passcode.
