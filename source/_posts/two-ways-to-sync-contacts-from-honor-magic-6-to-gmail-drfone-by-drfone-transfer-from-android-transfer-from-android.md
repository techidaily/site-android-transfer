## Part 5. 2 Methods To Transfer Contacts From iPhone to Android

This section will discuss two methods to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android. Similarly, in this iPhone-to-Android transfer case, the iPhone synchronization method and importing VCF file method can be used to move your contact list.

### Method 1. Enable iPhone Sync Feature

You can enable the iPhone Sync feature to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android device. In this case, ensure the contacts option in the Gmail synchronization is toggled on. Later, the contacts are saved when you sign in with the same Google account on your Honor Magic 6. Let's learn **how to transfer from phone to phone using this feature**:

- **Step 1.** Access the "Settings" app on your iPhone and navigate to the "Contacts" settings. Then, tap on "Accounts" and choose your Gmail account. Turn on the “Contacts” toggle switch to synchronize them.

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Honor Magic 6 with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
