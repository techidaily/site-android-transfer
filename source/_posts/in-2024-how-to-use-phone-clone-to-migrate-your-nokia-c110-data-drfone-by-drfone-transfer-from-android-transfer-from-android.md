Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Nokia C110 and copy or move the desired videos from your Nokia C110 to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Nokia C110.
