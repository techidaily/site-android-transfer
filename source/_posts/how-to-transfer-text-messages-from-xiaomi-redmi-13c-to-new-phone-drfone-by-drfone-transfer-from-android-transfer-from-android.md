![Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Xiaomi Redmi 13C devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

- On your Xiaomi Redmi 13C, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

- This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

- Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also, both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm the completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

Now, we’ll discuss how to transfer contacts from one Android to another with the help of a SIM card.

## Part 2: How to transfer contacts from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to Other Android Devices using SIM card?

**The PhoneCopy app on your Windows phone.**

1\. Power on your Xiaomi Redmi 13C smartphone.

Note: Make sure that the phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Store icon to open the Windows App Store.

Note: You must use your Microsoft account to sign in to Windows Store before the phone allows you to download the apps.

3\. Once you are on the "store" interface, search for and tap the "PhoneCopy" app

4\. On the next window that appears, tap "Install" pato install PhoneCopy on your Windows phone.

After you have successfully installed PhoneCopy on your Xiaomi Redmi 13C, it is now time to export all your contacts to the PhoneCopy server. You can do so by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Export data to the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. On your Windows phone, locate and tap to launch the "PhoneCopy" app.

2\. On the displayed interface, in the available fields provide your PhoneCopy account credentials (username and password) that you used to create your PhoneCopy account earlier.

3\. Once done, tap the"Export to phonecopy.com" button and wait till all your contacts are exported to the PhoneCopy server.

**Step 2: Import data to the iPhone from the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. Power on your iPhone.

Note: Make sure that your phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Apple App Store icon.

Note: Ensure that you are signed in to the App Store using your Apple ID.

3\. Search for, locate, download, and install the "PhoneCopy" app on your iPhone

4\. Once installed, tap the "PhoneCopy" icon on your iOS device to launch the program.

5\. When asked for, provide the same PhoneCopy credentials that you used to export the data from your Xiaomi Redmi 13C phone in the previous step.

6\. After you are signed in to your PhoneCopy account on your iPhone, click the "Synchronize" button to import all the data from the PhoneCopy server to your new iPhone.

Although PhoneCopy does a great job when it comes to transferring data between the phones from different platforms, the app comes with a few pros and cons which include:

Pros:

Registering and using PhoneCopy is free.

PhoneCopy can back up your calendar events, SMS, tasks, and notes and can help you import them on a different phone (typically on iPhone).

Cons:

Only up to 500 contacts, SMS, tasks, and notes can be synched while using the Basic version (free account) of PhoneCopy. To remove this restriction, you must buy the Premium version for which PhoneCopy charges $25 annually.

The archived data is auto-deleted from the PhoneCopy server after one month when using the Basic version, and after 1 year when using the Premium version.
