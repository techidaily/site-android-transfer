## Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ to iPad/iPhone

Transferring photos from your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it's essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won't make the same errors.

**1\. Insufficient battery levels**

Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad/iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.

**2\. Limited storage space**

Overlooking available storage space on the iPad/iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad/iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.

**3\. Interference from Third-Party Apps:**

Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.

**4\. Ignoring file compatibility:**

Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.

**5\. Skipping App Permissions:**

When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it's common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.

## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.
- **Step 3:** Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you'll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.
- **Step 4:** Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.
