## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Realme GT 3 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Realme GT 3 Migrate if you are a Realme GT 3 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Realme GT 3 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Realme GT 3 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Realme GT 3 models are now unable to run Realme GT 3 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Realme GT 3 to iPhone besides Realme GT 3 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Realme GT 3 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Realme GT 3 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Realme GT 3 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Realme GT 3 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Realme GT 3 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Realme GT 3 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.
