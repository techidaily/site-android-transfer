## Part 3: How to transfer music from Vivo G2 to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Vivo G2 to your system. Though, to transfer music from Vivo G2 to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Vivo G2 to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).
