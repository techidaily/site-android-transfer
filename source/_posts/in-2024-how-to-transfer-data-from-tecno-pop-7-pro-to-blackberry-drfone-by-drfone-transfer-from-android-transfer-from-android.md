## Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch

Another excellent option for transferring files to any Pixel phone is with Google’s Quick Switch adapters. These free OTG devices are included in every Pixel phone box and are designed to help you transfer data from an old phone to a new Pixel device.

Being an Android user requires a Google account, granting you access to 15 GB of free storage space on Google Drive, making the app an excellent way to transfer files from your old phone to your new one. Here’s how you can use it:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size.
