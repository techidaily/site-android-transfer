## Part 3: How to transfer music from Poco X6 to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Poco X6 to your system. Though, to transfer music from Poco X6 to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.

These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them.
