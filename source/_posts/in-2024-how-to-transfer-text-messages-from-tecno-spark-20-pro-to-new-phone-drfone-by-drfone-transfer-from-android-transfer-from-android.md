## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Tecno Spark 20 Pro to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Tecno Spark 20 Pro Migrate if you are a Tecno Spark 20 Pro user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Tecno Spark 20 Pro devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Tecno Spark 20 Pro device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Tecno Spark 20 Pro models are now unable to run Tecno Spark 20 Pro Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Tecno Spark 20 Pro to iPhone besides Tecno Spark 20 Pro Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Tecno Spark 20 Pro Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Tecno Spark 20 Pro to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Tecno Spark 20 Pro and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Tecno Spark 20 Pro and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Tecno Spark 20 Pro device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Tecno Spark 20 Pro phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.
