## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Vivo V27 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Vivo V27 Migrate if you are a Vivo V27 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Vivo V27 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Vivo V27 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Vivo V27 models are now unable to run Vivo V27 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Vivo V27 to iPhone besides Vivo V27 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Vivo V27 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Vivo V27 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Vivo V27 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Vivo V27 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Vivo V27 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Vivo V27 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Vivo V27 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Vivo V27 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Vivo V27 to iPhone via Apps & Data

You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Vivo V27 phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code
