## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Realme 11X 5G to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Realme 11X 5G to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme 11X 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Realme 11X 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Realme 11X 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Realme 11X 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Realme 11X 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Realme 11X 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Realme 11X 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

**Huawei Backup**

Huawei devices have HiSuite, an inbuilt manager tool. This app helps users to manage the data on their Huawei devices and also to back up and restore data. To backup and restore on Huawei devices using Hisuite, follow the steps below

1\. Download the tool [here](http://consumer.huawei.com/minisite/HiSuite_en/) and install. This tool is supported by windows only. Then, open the tool and connect your Huawei device to you PC by means of a USB cable.

2\. Go to settings app on your android device and click on “advanced settings”. Click on “security” and choose “Allow Hisuite to use HDB”. You will see the “Back Up” and “Restore” options. Click on “Back Up” and select the data you want to back up. You can encrypt your backup with a password. Then click on “Back Up”.

3\. Click on “Restore” to retrieve data from previous backups after selecting the backup file you want.
