### Method 2: iTunes

Using iTunes to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad involves a slightly indirect process. The variance in operating systems is the primary reason for this distinction. iTunes is primarily tailored for iOS devices; however, with supplemental steps, it can be utilized to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad. Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition and copy or move the desired videos from your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition.
