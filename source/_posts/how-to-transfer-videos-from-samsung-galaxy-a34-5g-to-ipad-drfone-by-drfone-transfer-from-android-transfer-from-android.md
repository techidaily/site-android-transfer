However, in this instance, we don’t mean the traditional data transfer between your phone and computer (we’ll get to that shortly). This trick involves connecting your old Android phone to your new Samsung Galaxy S23 with a USB cable.

It’s almost like Samsung’s Smart Switch, except you don’t need to download an app and can move more data. You can transfer everything from your old Android device’s internal storage to your new smartphone. Here’s how:

1. Connect your phones using a USB-C to USB-C cable. Your Samsung Galaxy S23 came with it.

2. Tap **Connected to Android**on your Galaxy S23 phone and select **MTP Host** (Media Transfer Protocol).

3. Tap **Allow**on your old Android to enable data access.

4. Choose the desired file manager on your new phone and browse your old Android’s internal storage.

5. Choose folders or files to transfer, tap the **kebab menu**for more options, and select **Copy to**.

6. Pick any location on your Samsung S23 phone (e.g., the **Downloads**folder for quick access) and tap **Copy**.

Moving data between phones using a USB cable is faster than Bluetooth but offers the same functionality. However, charge your devices beforehand because the data transfer may take a while (if you have many sizable files).

### 7\. Use an SD Card

We can almost see you fumbling with your Samsung S23, looking for an SD or microSD card slot. Newsflash: there isn’t one. Like its predecessors, S21 and S22, the Galaxy S23 series doesn’t support expandable storage.

How can you transfer data from an SD card, then? Well, there’s always your computer. You can migrate your SD card data to your desktop or laptop before moving it to your new Galaxy phone.

It may not be as straightforward as the methods above, but it’s ideal for keeping precious files from your old Android’s SD card. Here’s what to do:

1. Select the desired files or folders on your old Android, tap **Move**, and choose your **SD card**.

2. Connect the Android to your computer with a USB cable.
3. Tap **USB for file transfer**in the **Notification panel** and select **Transferring files / Android Auto**.

4. Go to **This PC**in **File Explorer** and open your phone under **Devices and drives**.
5. Right-click the folders or files you wish to move, select **Copy**, and paste them to any location on your computer.

6. Once you move the data, safely disconnect your old Android and connect your Samsung S23 to the PC.
7. Go to the folder with your newly saved data and copy-paste it to your Samsung S23.

This method is best for transferring photos, videos, and other files from an SD card you might not use anymore. After all, smartphone manufacturers increasingly ditch SD card slots for sleek, more compact designs.

## Conclusion

Switching from Samsung Galaxy A34 5G to Samsung S23 is a breeze because you have many data transfer options. Besides Samsung’s Smart Switch, you can use your synced Google Account, Google Drive, Bluetooth, or a USB-C to USB-C cable. You can also migrate data from your old Android SD card to your computer before transferring it to your new phone.

However, Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer might be your best option. Besides transferring files, it features many tools for seamless phone management, making it a fantastic addition to your digital toolbox.
