6. Connect your new Pixel phone to the PC.
7. Once again, click the phone’s notification and select the **File Transfer**
8. Transfer the contents of your computer’s folder onto the new device.
9. Disconnect the new device after your files have been copied.

You’ll need to consider which types of files go into which folders. For example, you’ll need to ensure that music data goes into Android’s Music folder, pictures and videos go into Camera or DCIM folders, and documents and downloads have their respective folders, which are typical on Android.

## Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch

Another excellent option for transferring files to any Pixel phone is with Google’s Quick Switch adapters. These free OTG devices are included in every Pixel phone box and are designed to help you transfer data from an old phone to a new Pixel device.

A Quick Switch adapter connects to your Pixel phone, and you can insert a Samsung-compatible USB cable on the other end to start the transfer process.

Here’s what you’ll need to do:

1. Power on your new Pixel 8/8 Pro phone and click **Start**.
2. Plug the Quick Switch adapter into the Pixel device and connect the USB cable with the USB-A end into the Quick Switch. Connect the other end to the Samsung phone.
3. Unlock your Samsung device and click the **Copy**
4. Select the type of data you want to transfer and hit **Copy**.

    ![copy data with quick switch adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-15.jpg)

5. Once the process is complete, click **Next** \> **Done**.

Before you start the file transfer process using a Quick Switch, you should ensure both devices are fully charged. Furthermore, you should also update your Samsung device to the latest software version to avoid potential transfer issues, such as data corruption or incomplete transfers.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Pixel Using Google Drive

Being an Android user requires a Google account, granting you access to 15 GB of free storage space on Google Drive, making the app an excellent way to transfer files from your old phone to your new one. Here’s how you can use it:

1. Using your old Samsung phone, navigate to **Settings**\> **Accounts and Backup**\> **Back up data** under **Google Drive**.

    ![back up google drive data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-16.jpg)

2. Change the **Backup details**and add the types of data you want to back up.
3. Hit the **Back up now**button and give your phone time to upload everything to Google Drive. You can watch the progress at the top of your screen.
4. Power on your new Pixel 8/8 Pro device and follow the on-screen setup instructions.
5. Log in with the same Google account you used on the Samsung phone.
6. The new device will immediately recognize older backups.

    ![restore from a google drive backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-17.jpg)

7. Choose the latest backup made on your Samsung phone and tap **Restore**to copy data from Samsung to Pixel.

It’s worth noting that Google Drive users aren’t limited to 15 GB of storage space, as paid plans also include 100 GB and 200 GB options for a few dollars per month, making this type of transfer incredibly efficient.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.

## Conclusion

Transferring data from one smartphone to another can be challenging, especially if you’re new to the whole thing or do it manually. To help you out, we’ve prepared the top seven methods for handling data transfers from Samsung to Google Pixel, which include the built-in data transfer tool during device setup, USB cables, Quick Switch adapter, Google Drive, email, and a dedicated third-party app – Wondershare Dr.Fone.

As you can see, it’s your safest bet, ensuring the most straightforward and fastest data transfer between your old and new device. This way, you won’t need to organize and transfer anything manually or risk losing data, and Wondershare Dr.Fone can be used even after the initial device setup.
