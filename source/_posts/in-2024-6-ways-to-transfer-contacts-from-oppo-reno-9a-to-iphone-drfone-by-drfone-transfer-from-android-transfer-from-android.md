If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Oppo Reno 9A to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Oppo Reno 9A to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Oppo Reno 9A Migrate if you are a Oppo Reno 9A user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Oppo Reno 9A devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Oppo Reno 9A device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Oppo Reno 9A models are now unable to run Oppo Reno 9A Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Oppo Reno 9A to iPhone besides Oppo Reno 9A Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App
