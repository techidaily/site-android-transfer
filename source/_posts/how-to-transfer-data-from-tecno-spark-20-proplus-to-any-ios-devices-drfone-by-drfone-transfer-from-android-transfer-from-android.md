## How to transfer contacts from Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ to iPhone XS/11 using SIM card

As you know the SIM card itself can hold a certain number of contacts, depending on the carrier and phone make and model.

1. Open the â€˜Contactsâ€™ app and click on â€˜Moreâ€™. Go to the â€˜Import/Exportâ€™ or simply â€˜Export Contactsâ€™ option there.
2. Click on â€˜Export to SIMâ€™ or â€˜SIM cardâ€™ and then select the source of contacts i.e. â€˜Phoneâ€™/â€™WhatsAppâ€™/â€™Googleâ€™/â€™Messengerâ€™.

1. Then hit â€˜Exportâ€™ and â€˜Continueâ€™ afterward.
2. Now, open the SIM card slot of your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ and unmount the SIM. Insert it on your iPhone XS/11 and turn it on. You can find the contacts on your iPhone.

**Note:** _Though, itâ€™s rare nowadays. In case you happen to own a very old SIM card and your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ supported the size. You might need to cut it to fit the iPhone XS/11â€™s micro-SIM slot._
