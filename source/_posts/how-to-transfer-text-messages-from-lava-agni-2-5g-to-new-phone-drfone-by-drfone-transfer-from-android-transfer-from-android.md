## How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly

Since Lava Agni 2 5G is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Lava Agni 2 5G, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Lava Agni 2 5G to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Lava Agni 2 5G to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Lava Agni 2 5G Migrate if you are a Lava Agni 2 5G user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Lava Agni 2 5G devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Lava Agni 2 5G device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Lava Agni 2 5G models are now unable to run Lava Agni 2 5G Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Lava Agni 2 5G to iPhone besides Lava Agni 2 5G Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Lava Agni 2 5G Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Lava Agni 2 5G to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Lava Agni 2 5G and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Lava Agni 2 5G and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Lava Agni 2 5G device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Lava Agni 2 5G device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Lava Agni 2 5G device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Lava Agni 2 5G phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Lava Agni 2 5G to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Lava Agni 2 5G to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones.

Want to learn how to transfer messages from android to iPhone without USB cables and computers? With the below steps, you can easily transfer messages and other data from Lava Agni 2 5G to iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) using Move to iOS -

Step 1: Click on the “Move Data from Android” button on the “Apps and Data” screen during the iPhone setup process. If you have already set up the Lava Agni 2 5G device, then you need to erase the data from Settings > General > Reset and then go to Apps and Data screen.

![transfer messages from android to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/move-data-from-android.JPG "Apps and data screen")
