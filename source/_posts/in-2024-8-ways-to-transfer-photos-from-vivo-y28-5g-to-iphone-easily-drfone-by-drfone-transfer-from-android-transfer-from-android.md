## Part 2: Transfer Files from Vivo Y28 5G to Other Android Devices by Nearby Share

Nearby Share is a method developed by Google to ****share files between Android phones****. It can be considered Google’s answer to Apple’s AirDrop, though, unlike AirDrop, it doesn’t require Wi-Fi. This method is available for all Android devices though you should use the latest Android OS for smoother working. Moreover, Bluetooth needs to be enabled to use this method.

### Step-by-Step Guide To Transfer Files via Nearby Share

****Step 1:**** You will need to activate “Nearby Share” on both devices first. To do that, go to the phone’s “Settings” and access the “Google” settings. Here, tap “Devices and Sharing,” and from the next appearing screen, choose “Nearby Share.”

![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Vivo Y28 5G with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
