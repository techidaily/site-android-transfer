The first method to transfer text messages from Itel P55+ to iPhone 12/XS (Max) is using the official Move to iOS app from Apple. Message history, call logs, contacts, web bookmarks, apps, etc. can be transferred from your Android to any iOS device. Though, I have noticed the app was acting strangely during data transfer. My Wi-Fi got some issues, and Move to iOS couldn’t properly complete the transfer.

**Guide for Move to iOS** **to transfer messages from Itel P55+ to iPhone 12/XS (Max)**

1. Download, install, and launch Move to iOS on your Itel P55+.
2. Get the iPhone 12/XS (Max) and configure the setup and then connect to Wi-Fi. Browse to the ‘Apps & Data’ option, click ‘Move Data from Android’ thereafter. Click the ‘Continue’ button and note the passcode.
