However, most of the latest Honor X50 models are now unable to run Honor X50 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Honor X50 to iPhone besides Honor X50 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Honor X50 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Honor X50 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Honor X50 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Honor X50 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Honor X50 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Honor X50 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Honor X50 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Honor X50 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

![Honor X50 to iPhone transfer via cloud services.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/transfer-data-from-motorola-to-iphone-8.jpg)

## Conclusion

Transitioning from a Honor X50 device to an iPhone, or vice versa, may present challenges due to the difference in operating systems. However, with the right tools and methods, the **iPhone to Honor X50 data transfer** can be done seamlessly and efficiently.

Even though Honor X50 Migrate is no longer in the game, apps like ShareIt and Move to iOS can be alternatives for a direct transfer. If things get a bit trickier when transferring from iPhone to Honor X50 due to Apple's privacy measures, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone's Phone Transfer is there to simplify it all.

And for those who prefer the cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive also offer a solution. So, no matter your preference, there's a solution to ensure your data transfer moves smoothly.
