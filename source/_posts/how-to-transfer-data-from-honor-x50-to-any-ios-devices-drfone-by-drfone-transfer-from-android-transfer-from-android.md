## How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly

Since Honor X50 is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Honor X50, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Honor X50 to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Honor X50 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Honor X50 Migrate if you are a Honor X50 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Honor X50 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Honor X50 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Honor X50 models are now unable to run Honor X50 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Honor X50 to iPhone besides Honor X50 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Honor X50 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Honor X50 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Honor X50 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Honor X50 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Honor X50 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Honor X50 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Honor X50 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Honor X50 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

As a solution, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone offers tools like Phone Transfer to simplify the process. With Dr. Fone's Phone Transfer, you can transfer any data from Honor X50 to iPhone or iPhone to Honor X50.
