## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Honor 90 GT to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Honor 90 GT before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Honor 90 GT, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Honor 90 GT’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.
- **Step 3:** Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you'll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.
- **Step 4:** Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.

## Simple Reminders to Copy Contacts From Honor 90 GT to iPhone Smoothly

It’s true to say that the five data transfer methods above are safe and effective. But generally speaking, we can’t deny that any process that involves the migration of data is sensitive in nature. That’s why it’s important to prepare both devices before officially initiating the data transfer process. Here are some reminders you need to keep in mind before you export contacts from Honor 90 GT to iPhone.

- Make sure your iPhone is fully charged and carrying enough internal storage.
- Incoming phone calls might interrupt the data transfer process in some ways. Hence, it’s best to turn the Airplane mode on both devices while the contacts are being migrated.
- Don’t use both devices once the data transfer has started.
- Lastly, create a backup file for your contact list. You never know what’s going to happen with the transfer. It’s best to be prepared to avoid data loss. Don’t worry. [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/)has a file backup feature that can help you a lot.

## Conclusion

Data transfer is a sensitive procedure. That’s why it’s highly recommended to opt for a conservative yet effective migration method to prevent serious issues. The five techniques above can surely help you copy contacts from Honor 90 GT to iPhone 14 or any model. Just make sure to prepare your mobile devices beforehand and settle on the data transfer option suitable to your needs. For a more convenient phone transfer solution, install Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer.
