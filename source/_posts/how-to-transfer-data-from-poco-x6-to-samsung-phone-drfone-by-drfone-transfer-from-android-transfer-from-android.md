Since Poco X6 is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Poco X6, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Poco X6 to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Poco X6 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Poco X6 Migrate if you are a Poco X6 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Poco X6 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Poco X6 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Poco X6 models are now unable to run Poco X6 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Poco X6 to iPhone besides Poco X6 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Poco X6 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Poco X6 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Poco X6 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Poco X6 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Poco X6 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
