1. Now, you need to add the same Gmail account to your iPhone X, in order to sync back contacts from it. For this, head to ‘Settings’ > ‘Passwords & Accounts’ > ‘Add Account’ > ‘Google’. Then, you’re required to punch in the details of the same Gmail account used over Android to sync contacts.

1. Lastly, get into ‘Settings’, then ‘Passwords & Accounts’, tap on your Gmail account and ensure that the ‘Contacts’ switch is turned on. Turn it on if it is not already. Within a short span of time, you can find the Android contacts appearing on your iPhone XS/11 after that.

## How to transfer contacts from Vivo Y100i to iPhone XS/11 using SIM card

As you know the SIM card itself can hold a certain number of contacts, depending on the carrier and phone make and model.

1. Open the ‘Contacts’ app and click on ‘More’. Go to the ‘Import/Export’ or simply ‘Export Contacts’ option there.
2. Click on ‘Export to SIM’ or ‘SIM card’ and then select the source of contacts i.e. ‘Phone’/’WhatsApp’/’Google’/’Messenger’.

1. Then hit ‘Export’ and ‘Continue’ afterward.
2. Now, open the SIM card slot of your Vivo Y100i and unmount the SIM. Insert it on your iPhone XS/11 and turn it on. You can find the contacts on your iPhone.

**Note:** _Though, it’s rare nowadays. In case you happen to own a very old SIM card and your Vivo Y100i supported the size. You might need to cut it to fit the iPhone XS/11’s micro-SIM slot._
