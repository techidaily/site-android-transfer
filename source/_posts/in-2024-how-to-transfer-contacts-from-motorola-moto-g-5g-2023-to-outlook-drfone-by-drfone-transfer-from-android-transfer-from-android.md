If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

On your Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
