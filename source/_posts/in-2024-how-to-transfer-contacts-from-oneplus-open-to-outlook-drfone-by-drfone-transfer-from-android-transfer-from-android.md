Nevertheless, you can learn how to clone Android phone using Google Drive by following these steps:

1\. Unlock your source Android device and go to Settings > Backup & Reset. From here, you can turn on the option to backup your data.

2\. Furthermore, you can verify the account on which you are taking the backup of your data and turn on the option of “Automatic Restore”.  This will be of great help if you are managing multiple accounts Android.

## Part 6: Clone OnePlus Open Phone Using Bluetooth

Using Bluetooth for cloning an Android phone is not the most efficient method. It is more suitable for transferring specific files than creating a comprehensive clone. Moreover, it's a slow and manual process that requires you to select and transfer files one by one. Here's how you can use Bluetooth for this purpose:

1\. On both Android devices, turn on Bluetooth and pair the OnePlus Open devices. Navigate to the file you want to send on the source device, tap "Share," and select "Bluetooth."

2\. Now, choose the targeted device to send the file. Move to the other device and "Accept" the incoming file transfer.
