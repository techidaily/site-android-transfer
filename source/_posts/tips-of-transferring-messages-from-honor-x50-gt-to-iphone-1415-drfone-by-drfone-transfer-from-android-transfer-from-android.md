Are you switching your phone to the latest iPhone 14 or 15 and wondering how to transfer your important text messages from your Honor X50 GT? Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.

Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.

This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to **transfer texts from Honor X50 GT to iPhone**. Let's explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.



When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Honor X50 GT to iPhone, Apple's official app, "Move to iOS," can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.

To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Honor X50 GT. Then, follow the steps to **transfer SMS from Honor X50 GT to iPhone** here:

## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Honor X50 GT to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Honor X50 GT before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Honor X50 GT, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Honor X50 GT’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.
- **Step 3:** Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you'll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.
- **Step 4:** Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.

![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Honor X50 GT with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

Note: Make sure that the phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Store icon to open the Windows App Store.

Note: You must use your Microsoft account to sign in to Windows Store before the phone allows you to download the apps.

3\. Once you are on the "store" interface, search for and tap the "PhoneCopy" app

4\. On the next window that appears, tap "Install" pato install PhoneCopy on your Windows phone.

After you have successfully installed PhoneCopy on your Honor X50 GT, it is now time to export all your contacts to the PhoneCopy server. You can do so by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Export data to the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. On your Windows phone, locate and tap to launch the "PhoneCopy" app.

2\. On the displayed interface, in the available fields provide your PhoneCopy account credentials (username and password) that you used to create your PhoneCopy account earlier.

3\. Once done, tap the"Export to phonecopy.com" button and wait till all your contacts are exported to the PhoneCopy server.

**Step 2: Import data to the iPhone from the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. Power on your iPhone.

Note: Make sure that your phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Apple App Store icon.

Note: Ensure that you are signed in to the App Store using your Apple ID.

3\. Search for, locate, download, and install the "PhoneCopy" app on your iPhone

4\. Once installed, tap the "PhoneCopy" icon on your iOS device to launch the program.

5\. When asked for, provide the same PhoneCopy credentials that you used to export the data from your Honor X50 GT phone in the previous step.

6\. After you are signed in to your PhoneCopy account on your iPhone, click the "Synchronize" button to import all the data from the PhoneCopy server to your new iPhone.

Although PhoneCopy does a great job when it comes to transferring data between the phones from different platforms, the app comes with a few pros and cons which include:

Pros:

Registering and using PhoneCopy is free.

PhoneCopy can back up your calendar events, SMS, tasks, and notes and can help you import them on a different phone (typically on iPhone).

Cons:

Only up to 500 contacts, SMS, tasks, and notes can be synched while using the Basic version (free account) of PhoneCopy. To remove this restriction, you must buy the Premium version for which PhoneCopy charges $25 annually.

The archived data is auto-deleted from the PhoneCopy server after one month when using the Basic version, and after 1 year when using the Premium version.
