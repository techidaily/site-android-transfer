Make sure that you have an active Internet connection, and that background data is switched off.

3. Select "Only Device". Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the OnePlus 11R device to display.

These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account.
