Since it is a complete Android phone manager, you can use it to transfer all the other kinds of data (like photos, videos, contacts, messages, and more) from one source to another. Unlike Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer that moves all the music files at once, you can perform a selective data transfer. The interface will provide a preview of your data so that you can choose the files you wish to move. To learn how to transfer music from Sony Xperia 1 V to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

5. Wait a moment and let the application automatically transfer your selected music files from your Sony Xperia 1 V to your iPhone.

    Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Sony Xperia 1 V to iTunes as well.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Sony Xperia 1 V to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Sony Xperia 1 V to your system. Though, to transfer music from Sony Xperia 1 V to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Sony Xperia 1 V to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).

- **Step 1.** First, open the “Google Contacts” app on your Sony Xperia 1 V and tap the "Profile" icon at the top right corner. Following this, head to the "Contacts settings" and choose the "Google Contacts sync settings" option.
