When Xiaomi 13T Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Xiaomi 13T to iPhone transfer**.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Xiaomi 13T device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
