## Part 3. How to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?

Bluetooth transfer is one of the oldest methods that can be used to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices, and it is a simple way to make use of it.

**Here are the steps to follow to know how to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices.**

**Step 1.** There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your Vivo Y02T

**Method 1:** The first method is to swipe from top to down on your Vivo Y02T to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.

**Method 2:** Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your Vivo Y02T, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.

**Step 2.** Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.

Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.

**Step 3.** The final step is to head to the File Manager app on your phone or go to your Music Player, select the music file you wish to transfer, and then click on your device's Share button or logo.

Here, scroll until you see the “Bluetooth” option. You will be immediately prompted to select the Vivo Y02T device to share with, click the earlier paired device name, and then click on “Accept” on the other device.

This is how you can transfer music files from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth.

## Part 4. How to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices using NFC?

NFC or Near Field Communication is another wireless means to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices. Although, unlike Bluetooth, this method requires contact between the two devices making the transfer.

**Below are the steps on how to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices using NFC.**

**Step 1.** First, enable NFC connection on both the Vivo Y02T devices between which you want to transfer the music files. To switch on NFC on Android, go to Phone’s “Settings” and click on “More Settings” under “Wireless and Network” options. Now click on the NFC button to ensure that it is switched On. Do the same on the other Android device as well.

**Step 2.** Before you begin to transfer, you need to touch the back of both devices (whose NFC has already been turned on), you will notice that both devices vibrate upon a successful connection. This means you can now start transferring your music files.
