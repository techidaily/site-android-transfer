As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Gionee F3 Pro with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Gionee F3 Pro and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Gionee F3 Pro and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Gionee F3 Pro device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Gionee F3 Pro device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Gionee F3 Pro device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
