## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Realme C67 4G to iPhone

Itâs probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. Itâs not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Realme C67 4G device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. Thatâs why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiverâs device does not support the data youâre trying to send. But donât worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Realme C67 4G to iPhone 15 if your first try doesnât work out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiverâs device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.
