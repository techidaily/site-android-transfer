### Steps To Transfer Files from Lava Storm 5G to Other Android Devices With Dr.Fone

Aside from being the fastest way to transfer files between Android phones, it also has the simplest transfer process. You only need Dr.Fone installed on your system and a couple of USB cables to use this method. Here is how you can ****transfer files from phone to phone**** via Dr.Fone:

****Step 1: Establish the Connection Between Android Devices****

Use USB cables to connect both Android devices to the computer and launch Dr.Fone app. From the “Home” screen, click “Phone Transfer” and wait for the program to assign devices to the correct positions.

****Step 2: Assign Android Devices to their Correct Positions****

For transferring data from the old Android device to the new one, the old device should be at the “Source” position and the new device at the “Destination” position. If the positions assigned by the program are incorrect, use the “Flip” button to correct them.
