## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iPhone 15 conveniently.

**Camera:**

Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus have three cameras: a 12MP main camera and a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 64MP telephoto camera. The front camera comes in 10MP. On the other side, Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with a 108MP main camera, 12MP ultra-wide, and two 10MP telephoto cameras. Among these two telephoto cameras, one has 3x zoom capacity, and the other has 10X zoom capacity. S21 Ultra has a laser autofocus sensor that will track the subject and take the perfect shot. For video recording, three of these models have great video features. However, S21 Ultra is offering you the bright night sensor so you can record and take pictures in low light.

**Battery and Charging:**

Regarding the battery performance and charging system, there are many differences among Samsung Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra. Samsun Galaxy S21 has 4000 mAh battery capacity, Galaxy S21 Plus comes in 4800 mAh, and Galaxy S21 Ultra has 5000 mAh. So, comparatively, Galaxy S21 Ultra has the best quality battery. The charging system is the same for all of these three models. It needs 25W on a wired connection. You can also charge them wireless on 15W.

**Connectivity:**

In these three models, you will get 5G. So, there is no argument about this. However, Galaxy S21 Plus and S21 Ultra have been manufactured with Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) chips. It is a new feature that will provide hands-free control. Using these features, you can unlock your car or find the SmartTag tracker. Among these, S21 Ultra offers you more. It has Wi-Fi 6E compatibility, which is the fastest and lowest latency for Wi-Fi connection.

## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Vivo T2 Pro 5G to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Vivo T2 Pro 5G before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Vivo T2 Pro 5G, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Vivo T2 Pro 5G’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.
- **Step 3:** Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you'll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.
- **Step 4:** Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.
