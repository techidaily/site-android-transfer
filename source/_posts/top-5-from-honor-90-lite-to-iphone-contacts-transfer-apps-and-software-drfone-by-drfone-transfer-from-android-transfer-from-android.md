As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Honor 90 Lite with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

Since Honor 90 Lite is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Honor 90 Lite, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Honor 90 Lite to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

However, most of the latest Honor 90 Lite models are now unable to run Honor 90 Lite Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Honor 90 Lite to iPhone besides Honor 90 Lite Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Honor 90 Lite Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Honor 90 Lite to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Honor 90 Lite and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Honor 90 Lite and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Honor 90 Lite device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Honor 90 Lite device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Honor 90 Lite device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Honor 90 Lite to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Honor 90 Lite to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

- **Step 5:** Transfer complete.

## Part 3. How to Do Honor 90 Lite to iPhone Data Transfer Using Dropbox/Google Drive

Another method for **Honor 90 Lite to iPhone transfer** is using Cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Both Dropbox and Google Drive serve as virtual storage spaces accessible from any device with an internet connection. Users can upload and store their files to the cloud, making them available for download on other devices.

Either Google Drive or Dropbox follows similar steps for data transfer. The difference between them is in the amount of free storage each service provides. Notably, Google Drive provides 15GB of free storage, while Dropbox offers 2GB.

Follow these steps on how to do a Honor 90 Lite to iPhone transfer via cloud storage services.

- **Step 1:** Install and set up Dropbox/Google Drive:

Begin by installing the Dropbox or Google Drive app on both your Honor 90 Lite and iPhone. Create accounts if you don't have them already.

- **Step 2:** Upload the files from Honor 90 Lite

Open the cloud storage app on your Honor 90 Lite device and upload the data you want to transfer. This can include photos, videos, documents, and more. Then, wait for the upload to complete. Make sure that all files are successfully uploaded before proceeding.

- **Step 3:** Sign in to the cloud storage on your iPhone

On your iPhone, open Dropbox or Google Drive and sign in with the same account. Find the transferred files in the cloud storage.

- **Step 4:** Download to iPhone:

Select the files you want to transfer and download them to your iPhone. Once the download is complete, organize the transferred files on your iPhone as needed.

## Conclusion

Transitioning from a Honor 90 Lite device to an iPhone, or vice versa, may present challenges due to the difference in operating systems. However, with the right tools and methods, the **iPhone to Honor 90 Lite data transfer** can be done seamlessly and efficiently.

Even though Honor 90 Lite Migrate is no longer in the game, apps like ShareIt and Move to iOS can be alternatives for a direct transfer. If things get a bit trickier when transferring from iPhone to Honor 90 Lite due to Apple's privacy measures, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone's Phone Transfer is there to simplify it all.

And for those who prefer the cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive also offer a solution. So, no matter your preference, there's a solution to ensure your data transfer moves smoothly.
