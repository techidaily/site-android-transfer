## Part 4. How to transfer music from Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition to Other Android Devices using NFC?

NFC or Near Field Communication is another wireless means to transfer music from Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition to Other Android Devices. Although, unlike Bluetooth, this method requires contact between the two devices making the transfer.

**Below are the steps on how to transfer music from Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition to Other Android Devices using NFC.**

**Step 1.** First, enable NFC connection on both the Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition devices between which you want to transfer the music files. To switch on NFC on Android, go to Phone’s “Settings” and click on “More Settings” under “Wireless and Network” options. Now click on the NFC button to ensure that it is switched On. Do the same on the other Android device as well.

**Step 2.** Before you begin to transfer, you need to touch the back of both devices (whose NFC has already been turned on), you will notice that both devices vibrate upon a successful connection. This means you can now start transferring your music files.
