## Part 2: Transfer Data Using PhoneCopy

With PhoneCopy you can easily export data from your Itel A70 to the PhoneCopy server, and then import the data from the PhoneCopy server to your new iOS device. It is easy to **transfer contacts from Itel A70 to iPhone** with PhoneCopy. What you need is PhoneCopy iPhone Itel A70.

In order to do so, you need:

**A registered PhoneCopy account.**

1\. On your computer, open any web browser of your choice and go to <https://www.phonecopy.com/en/>.

Note: Make sure your device is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the right section of the opened web page, click "REGISTER NOW."

3\. On the "REGISTRATION" page, populate the available fields with the correct values and click "CONTINUE" from the bottom.

4\. Follow the on-screen instructions thereafter to complete the account creation process.

Note: You may need to activate your account using the confirmation mail that you would receive while completing the account creation process.

**The PhoneCopy app on your Windows phone.**

1\. Power on your Itel A70 smartphone.

Note: Make sure that the phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Store icon to open the Windows App Store.

Note: You must use your Microsoft account to sign in to Windows Store before the phone allows you to download the apps.

3\. Once you are on the "store" interface, search for and tap the "PhoneCopy" app

4\. On the next window that appears, tap "Install" pato install PhoneCopy on your Windows phone.

After you have successfully installed PhoneCopy on your Itel A70, it is now time to export all your contacts to the PhoneCopy server. You can do so by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Export data to the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. On your Windows phone, locate and tap to launch the "PhoneCopy" app.

2\. On the displayed interface, in the available fields provide your PhoneCopy account credentials (username and password) that you used to create your PhoneCopy account earlier.

3\. Once done, tap the"Export to phonecopy.com" button and wait till all your contacts are exported to the PhoneCopy server.

**Step 2: Import data to the iPhone from the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. Power on your iPhone.

Note: Make sure that your phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Apple App Store icon.

Note: Ensure that you are signed in to the App Store using your Apple ID.

3\. Search for, locate, download, and install the "PhoneCopy" app on your iPhone

4\. Once installed, tap the "PhoneCopy" icon on your iOS device to launch the program.

5\. When asked for, provide the same PhoneCopy credentials that you used to export the data from your Itel A70 phone in the previous step.

6\. After you are signed in to your PhoneCopy account on your iPhone, click the "Synchronize" button to import all the data from the PhoneCopy server to your new iPhone.

Although PhoneCopy does a great job when it comes to transferring data between the phones from different platforms, the app comes with a few pros and cons which include:

Pros:

Registering and using PhoneCopy is free.

PhoneCopy can back up your calendar events, SMS, tasks, and notes and can help you import them on a different phone (typically on iPhone).

Cons:

Only up to 500 contacts, SMS, tasks, and notes can be synched while using the Basic version (free account) of PhoneCopy. To remove this restriction, you must buy the Premium version for which PhoneCopy charges $25 annually.

The archived data is auto-deleted from the PhoneCopy server after one month when using the Basic version, and after 1 year when using the Premium version.
