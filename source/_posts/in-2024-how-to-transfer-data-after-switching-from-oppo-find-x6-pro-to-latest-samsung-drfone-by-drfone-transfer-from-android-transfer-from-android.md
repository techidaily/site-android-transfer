![samsung galaxy s23 on a table](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-2.jpg)

You can save all data after switching from Oppo Find X6 Pro to Samsung S23. It doesn’t matter which Android phone you’ve used before buying the latest Samsung model because you have many data transfer options.

Samsung Smart Switch may have features exclusive to Galaxy devices (among other limitations), but all methods let you transfer data seamlessly from Oppo Find X6 Pro to Samsung S23. Here’s how each works.

The following methods will help you move data from Oppo Find X6 Pro to Samsung S23 within minutes. Each is straightforward, so your choice will depend on your preferences. Let’s dive in.

### 1\. Transfer Data Using Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer

Wondershare Dr.Fone is an all-in-one phone manager offering multiple tools. Besides moving data between phones, it lets you repair your Android system, recover files and passwords, remove lock screens, and erase data. You can even transfer WhatsApp, Viber, WeChat, and LINE chats and files.



Here’s how to move data from Oppo Find X6 Pro to Samsung S23 with Wondershare Dr.Fone:

1. Download and install the app on your computer.
2. Go to **Toolbox > Phone Transfer**.

![wondershare dr.fone toolbox](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

3. Connect your old Android and Samsung S23 to the computer with USB cables.

![wondershare dr.fone phone transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-android-to-android-1.png)

5. Select the categories to copy to Samsung S23 and click **Start Transfer**.

![data transfer with wondershare dr.fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-android-to-android-2.png)

Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer lets you move apps, contacts, photos, videos, music, ringtones, text messages, voice memos, call logs, bookmarks, and calendar data between Android devices.

### 2\. Move Data From Oppo Find X6 Pro to Samsung Using Smart Switch

Samsung’s Smart Switch app is excellent for moving data (even settings) between Android devices. However, you can only transfer settings, memos (including voice), and app data between Galaxy phones.

Also, you can’t transfer apps you haven’t downloaded from the Play Store or encrypted data like WhatsApp chats. Wondershare Dr.Fone is better if you don’t want to lose your IM conversations.

Here’s how to move data from Oppo Find X6 Pro to Samsung S23 with Smart Switch:

1. Download and install Smart Switch on both phones and place them next to one another.
2. Get your Samsung S23 and go to **Settings > Accounts and backup > Bring data from an old device**.

![samsung smart switch options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-3.jpg)

3. On your Samsung S23, tap **Receive data**and choose **Galaxy/Android** as the source.

![android to samsung data transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-4.jpg)

4. Tap **Send data**on your old phone and select **Wireless** (it’s faster than a cable connection). Tap **Allow** to enable data access.

![establishing a wireless connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-5.jpg)

5. Choose the desired data using your Samsung S23, tap **Transfer**, then **Go to the Home screen**once everything is on your new phone.

![moving data with smart switch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-6.jpg)

Remember to charge both phones before transferring data or connect them to a power source to ensure the process goes smoothly.

### 3\. Transfer Data Using Google Account Sync

Backing up your Google Account data with Google One means accessing it on any device upon login. The backup includes apps, phone settings, messages, calls, photos, videos, and your chosen Google Account data (e.g., contacts, calendar, emails, and documents).

Here’s how to transfer data to Samsung Galaxy S23 using Google Account synchronization:

1. Go to **Settings > Google > Backup > Google Account data**on your old Android phone and toggle on the desired switches for synchronization.

![transferring google account data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-7.jpg)

2. On your Samsung S23, go to **Settings > Google**and log into your backed-up Google Account.

Everything you’ve previously backed up will automatically sync once you log into your Google Account.

### 4\. Share Data via Bluetooth

Bluetooth may be slower than most data-sharing methods, but its reliability is why we never have to imagine life without it. It may not support transferring settings or downloaded apps, but it’s excellent for moving all your photos, videos, music, and other files.

Here’s how to share data between Android and Samsung S23 via Bluetooth:

1. Go to **Settings > Connections**and toggle on the **Bluetooth** switch on both phones. Alternatively, use a shortcut in the **Notification panel**.

![turning on bluetooth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-8.jpg)

2. Pair the phones and select folders or files you wish to transfer to your Samsung Galaxy S23.
3. Tap **Share > Bluetooth**and choose your new phone.

![transferring data via bluetooth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-9.jpg)

Sharing data via Bluetooth may take a while, but this valuable feature will bring everything you need to your new smartphone.

### 5\. Use Google Drive

Google Drive is a prominent cloud storage and file-sharing platform. You’re missing out if you don’t use it. It lets you synchronize data across devices, access files in the cloud, and create presentation slides, spreadsheets, forms, and documents (online and offline).

Transferring data from Oppo Find X6 Pro to Samsung S23 is seamless with Google Drive. Here’s what to do:

1. Launch Google Drive on your old Android and tap **New > Upload**. The **New**button features only a **plus sign** on some devices.

![uploading data to google drive](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-10.jpg)

2. Add all folders or files you wish to transfer to your new phone.
3. Open Google Drive on your Samsung S23 and sign into the correct account.
4. Select the uploaded data, tap the **kebab menu**(the three vertical dots in the top right corner), and hit **Download**.

![downloading data from google drive](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-11.jpg)

Google Drive may limit you to 15 GB of free storage, but it’s among the best Google apps for sharing files across devices. You may already use its desktop version to collaborate on docs and spreadsheets, so why not leverage its handy mobile app?

### 6\. Transfer Data Using a USB Cable

USB cables—the unsung heroes of connectivity. Like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, we can’t imagine life without them. They’re perfect for transferring data between devices.

However, in this instance, we don’t mean the traditional data transfer between your phone and computer (we’ll get to that shortly). This trick involves connecting your old Android phone to your new Samsung Galaxy S23 with a USB cable.

It’s almost like Samsung’s Smart Switch, except you don’t need to download an app and can move more data. You can transfer everything from your old Android device’s internal storage to your new smartphone. Here’s how:

1. Connect your phones using a USB-C to USB-C cable. Your Samsung Galaxy S23 came with it.

![connecting phones with a usb cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-12.jpg)

2. Tap **Connected to Android**on your Galaxy S23 phone and select **MTP Host** (Media Transfer Protocol).

![establishing a usb connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-13.jpg)

3. Tap **Allow**on your old Android to enable data access.

![allowing data access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-14.jpg)

4. Choose the desired file manager on your new phone and browse your old Android’s internal storage.

![accessing android data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-15.jpg)

5. Choose folders or files to transfer, tap the **kebab menu**for more options, and select **Copy to**.

![choosing data to transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-16.jpg)

6. Pick any location on your Samsung S23 phone (e.g., the **Downloads**folder for quick access) and tap **Copy**.

![transferring data to samsung s23](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-17.jpg)

Moving data between phones using a USB cable is faster than Bluetooth but offers the same functionality. However, charge your devices beforehand because the data transfer may take a while (if you have many sizable files).

### 7\. Use an SD Card

We can almost see you fumbling with your Samsung S23, looking for an SD or microSD card slot. Newsflash: there isn’t one. Like its predecessors, S21 and S22, the Galaxy S23 series doesn’t support expandable storage.

How can you transfer data from an SD card, then? Well, there’s always your computer. You can migrate your SD card data to your desktop or laptop before moving it to your new Galaxy phone.

It may not be as straightforward as the methods above, but it’s ideal for keeping precious files from your old Android’s SD card. Here’s what to do:

1. Select the desired files or folders on your old Android, tap **Move**, and choose your **SD card**.

![moving files to an sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-18.jpg)

2. Connect the Android to your computer with a USB cable.
3. Tap **USB for file transfer**in the **Notification panel** and select **Transferring files / Android Auto**.

![choosing a usb for file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-19.jpg)

4. Go to **This PC**in **File Explorer** and open your phone under **Devices and drives**.
5. Right-click the folders or files you wish to move, select **Copy**, and paste them to any location on your computer.

![transferring files to a pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-20.jpg)

6. Once you move the data, safely disconnect your old Android and connect your Samsung S23 to the PC.
7. Go to the folder with your newly saved data and copy-paste it to your Samsung S23.

This method is best for transferring photos, videos, and other files from an SD card you might not use anymore. After all, smartphone manufacturers increasingly ditch SD card slots for sleek, more compact designs.

## Conclusion

Switching from Oppo Find X6 Pro to Samsung S23 is a breeze because you have many data transfer options. Besides Samsung’s Smart Switch, you can use your synced Google Account, Google Drive, Bluetooth, or a USB-C to USB-C cable. You can also migrate data from your old Android SD card to your computer before transferring it to your new phone.

However, Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer might be your best option. Besides transferring files, it features many tools for seamless phone management, making it a fantastic addition to your digital toolbox.
