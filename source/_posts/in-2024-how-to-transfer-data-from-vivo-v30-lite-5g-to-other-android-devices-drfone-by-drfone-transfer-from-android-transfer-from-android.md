2. Go to the Google Account that you have used as your backup preference.

4. If it is already on and is still not working, try toggling the option on and off a few times.

Make sure that you have an active Internet connection, and that background data is switched off.

1. Switch Off and Switch On your Data Connection.

4. Select Clear Cache and also Clear Data.
5. This should knock the Contacts sync back to normal and ensure that your sync goes on without a hitch from there on out.

3. Select "Only Device". Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device to display.
4. Tap on "Menu" and then on "Merge Accounts"

6. Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting "Contacts to Display", then "All Contacts"

However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts.
