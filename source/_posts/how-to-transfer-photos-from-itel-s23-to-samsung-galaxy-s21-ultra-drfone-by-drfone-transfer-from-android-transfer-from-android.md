Whether you want to transfer data, i.e. images or videos or text messages, the steps that are mentioned below remains the same.

**Step 1:** Grab your copy of the Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android) from its official website and then install it over your PC. Now, launch the tool and then opt for the “Transfer” tab from the main screen. Meanwhile, get your “Source” device connected with your PC using the genuine USB cable only.

**Step 2:** Next, once your device is detected by the tool, you need to get into the required data section from the navigation panel at the top. For instance, “Information” in this case. Meanwhile, get your target device connected to the PC too.
