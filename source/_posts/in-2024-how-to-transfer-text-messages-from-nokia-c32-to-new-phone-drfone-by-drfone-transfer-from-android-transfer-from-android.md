The best part of the Huawei Phone Clone is that it supports not only Android but it also supports the iPhone. All the things that you can do while transferring data from one Android to another, you can achieve the same feat while transferring data from one iPhone to another iPhone. It is especially useful when you get that big update to your iPhone version, and most of the apps get useless due to the drastic hardware and software change in old and new iPhones. Thinking about changing your old iPhone to a new one could have been disastrous if not catastrophic if personal data could not have been transferable from one mobile to another. Phone Clone by Huawei lets you simply achieve the task while at the same time saving you a lot of data and time

Now, let us take a look at how you can use Phone Clone Nokia app without spending a penny on expensive services and with 4 simple steps:

1\. Install the Phone Clone app on old and new iPhone mobile

2\. Open the app for the new iPhone. Click on the send button. A Wi-Fi hotspot will be created, displaying its name and password.
