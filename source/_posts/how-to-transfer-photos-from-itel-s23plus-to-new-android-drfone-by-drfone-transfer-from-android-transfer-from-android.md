The phone industry, for years, has constantly improved on the design and development of mobile phones being released into the market. One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.

## Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Itel S23+ to New Android Using NFC

![Transfer Photos from Itel S23+ to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Itel S23+ devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Itel S23+, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

![Transfer Photos from Itel S23+ to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Itel S23+ to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Itel S23+ to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

![Transfer Photos from Itel S23+ to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg)

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Itel S23+, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

![Transfer Photos from Itel S23+ to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg)

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Itel S23+ from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

5\. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

## Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth

### 6\. Transfer Data Using a USB Cable

USB cables—the unsung heroes of connectivity. Like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, we can’t imagine life without them. They’re perfect for transferring data between devices.

However, in this instance, we don’t mean the traditional data transfer between your phone and computer (we’ll get to that shortly). This trick involves connecting your old Android phone to your new Samsung Galaxy S23 with a USB cable.

It’s almost like Samsung’s Smart Switch, except you don’t need to download an app and can move more data. You can transfer everything from your old Android device’s internal storage to your new smartphone. Here’s how:

1. Connect your phones using a USB-C to USB-C cable. Your Samsung Galaxy S23 came with it.

2. Tap **Connected to Android**on your Galaxy S23 phone and select **MTP Host** (Media Transfer Protocol).

![establishing a usb connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-13.jpg)

3. Tap **Allow**on your old Android to enable data access.

4. Choose the desired file manager on your new phone and browse your old Android’s internal storage.

![accessing android data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-15.jpg)

5. Choose folders or files to transfer, tap the **kebab menu**for more options, and select **Copy to**.

![choosing data to transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-16.jpg)

6. Pick any location on your Samsung S23 phone (e.g., the **Downloads**folder for quick access) and tap **Copy**.

Moving data between phones using a USB cable is faster than Bluetooth but offers the same functionality. However, charge your devices beforehand because the data transfer may take a while (if you have many sizable files).

### 7\. Use an SD Card

We can almost see you fumbling with your Samsung S23, looking for an SD or microSD card slot. Newsflash: there isn’t one. Like its predecessors, S21 and S22, the Galaxy S23 series doesn’t support expandable storage.

How can you transfer data from an SD card, then? Well, there’s always your computer. You can migrate your SD card data to your desktop or laptop before moving it to your new Galaxy phone.

It may not be as straightforward as the methods above, but it’s ideal for keeping precious files from your old Android’s SD card. Here’s what to do:

1. Select the desired files or folders on your old Android, tap **Move**, and choose your **SD card**.

![moving files to an sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-18.jpg)

2. Connect the Android to your computer with a USB cable.
3. Tap **USB for file transfer**in the **Notification panel** and select **Transferring files / Android Auto**.

![choosing a usb for file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-19.jpg)

4. Go to **This PC**in **File Explorer** and open your phone under **Devices and drives**.
5. Right-click the folders or files you wish to move, select **Copy**, and paste them to any location on your computer.

6. Once you move the data, safely disconnect your old Android and connect your Samsung S23 to the PC.
7. Go to the folder with your newly saved data and copy-paste it to your Samsung S23.

This method is best for transferring photos, videos, and other files from an SD card you might not use anymore. After all, smartphone manufacturers increasingly ditch SD card slots for sleek, more compact designs.

## Conclusion

Switching from Itel S23+ to Samsung S23 is a breeze because you have many data transfer options. Besides Samsung’s Smart Switch, you can use your synced Google Account, Google Drive, Bluetooth, or a USB-C to USB-C cable. You can also migrate data from your old Android SD card to your computer before transferring it to your new phone.

However, Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer might be your best option. Besides transferring files, it features many tools for seamless phone management, making it a fantastic addition to your digital toolbox.
