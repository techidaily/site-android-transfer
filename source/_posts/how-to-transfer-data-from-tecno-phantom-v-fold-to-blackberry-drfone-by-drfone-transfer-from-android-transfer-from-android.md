As with other data management software, you can download and install apps onto your Tecno Phantom V Fold from your PC. The advantage of this is that apps can be downloaded quickly, and also without costing you in terms of data roaming charges.

A neat feature is the ability to uninstall apps that came preloaded on the phone as often we find ourselves with apps that we never use that we cannot delete.

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Tecno Phantom V Fold with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
