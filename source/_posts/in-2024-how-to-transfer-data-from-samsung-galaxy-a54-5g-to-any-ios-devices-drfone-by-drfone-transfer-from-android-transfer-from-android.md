### Step 1. Connect Android phone with a computer and run Dr.Fone

To start with, connect your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G with a computer either via a USB cable. Run Dr.Fone on your computer and choose Transfer fron the main window Then, your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G will be detected instantly. After that, the primary window will appears like the screenshot shows below.

### Step 2. Android to Outlook sync

Then, click "Contacts" under "Information" panel on the top. In the contact management window, choose the contacts that you want to export. Click "Export" button. When the drop-down menu pops up, you can either click "Export selected contacts to computer" or "Export all contacts to computer". After that, click "to Outlook Express" or "to Outlook 2003/2007/2010/2013". Then, the contract transferring begins. Be sure your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G is connected all the time.

As you see, apart from exporting Android contacts to Outlook, you can also copy contacts from Samsung Galaxy A54 5G to vCard, Windows Live Mail and Windows Address Book. If you have a Gmail account, you’re able to export Android contacts to your computer, and then backup these Android contacts to your Gmail account too.
