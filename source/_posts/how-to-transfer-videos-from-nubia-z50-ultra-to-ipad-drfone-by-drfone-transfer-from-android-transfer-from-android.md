Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.

### Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on

Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone's private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.

### Tip 4: Plug both devices to power

You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Nubia Z50 Ultra devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.

### Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer

Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.

### Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization

- Wait for the data transfer process to complete.

To transfer content from your iPhone to Android device directly, open Dr. Fone – Phone Transfer on android and tap 'import from a USB cable.' Use the iOS-to-android cable to connect your iOS and Android devices.

Dr. Fone – Phone Transfer will begin to scan data on your iPhone. The time will depend on the content on the iPhone.

Tap on 'start importing' once all data has been detected.

## Part 4: \[Alternative\] Move to iOS not working solved with a PC

The following steps will help you transfer data from android to an iOS device using a PC.

- Open the Dr. Fone program on your computer and click 'phone transfer' from the modules displayed.
