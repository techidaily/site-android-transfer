This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.

To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.

To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.

5\. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.

## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436" border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra to iPhone 15 conveniently.
