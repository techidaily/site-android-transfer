**Step 1.** There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your Honor X9a

**Method 1:** The first method is to swipe from top to down on your Honor X9a to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.

**Method 2:** Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your Honor X9a, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.
