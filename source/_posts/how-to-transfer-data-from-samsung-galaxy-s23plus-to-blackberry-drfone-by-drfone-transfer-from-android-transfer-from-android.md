    ![copy data to the pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-14.jpg)

## Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch

Another excellent option for transferring files to any Pixel phone is with Google’s Quick Switch adapters. These free OTG devices are included in every Pixel phone box and are designed to help you transfer data from an old phone to a new Pixel device.

A Quick Switch adapter connects to your Pixel phone, and you can insert a Samsung-compatible USB cable on the other end to start the transfer process.

Here’s what you’ll need to do:

Before you start the file transfer process using a Quick Switch, you should ensure both devices are fully charged. Furthermore, you should also update your Samsung device to the latest software version to avoid potential transfer issues, such as data corruption or incomplete transfers.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Pixel Using Google Drive

Being an Android user requires a Google account, granting you access to 15 GB of free storage space on Google Drive, making the app an excellent way to transfer files from your old phone to your new one. Here’s how you can use it:

1. Using your old Samsung phone, navigate to **Settings**\> **Accounts and Backup**\> **Back up data** under **Google Drive**.

    ![back up google drive data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-16.jpg)

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.

To help you out, we’ve prepared the top seven methods for handling data transfers from Samsung to Google Pixel, which include the built-in data transfer tool during device setup, USB cables, Quick Switch adapter, Google Drive, email, and a dedicated third-party app – Wondershare Dr.Fone.
