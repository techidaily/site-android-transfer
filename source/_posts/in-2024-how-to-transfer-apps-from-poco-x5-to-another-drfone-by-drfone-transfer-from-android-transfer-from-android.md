2. Change the **Backup details**and add the types of data you want to back up.
3. Hit the **Back up now**button and give your phone time to upload everything to Google Drive. You can watch the progress at the top of your screen.

    ![restore from a google drive backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-17.jpg)

7. Choose the latest backup made on your Samsung phone and tap **Restore**to copy data from Samsung to Pixel.

It’s worth noting that Google Drive users aren’t limited to 15 GB of storage space, as paid plans also include 100 GB and 200 GB options for a few dollars per month, making this type of transfer incredibly efficient.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.
