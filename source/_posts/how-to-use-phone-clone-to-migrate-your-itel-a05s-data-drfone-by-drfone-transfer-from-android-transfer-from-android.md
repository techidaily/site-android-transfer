## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Itel A05s to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Itel A05s before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Itel A05s, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Itel A05s’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.
- **Step 2:** Select "Backup" or "Backup & Restore". Within the "System" settings, look for the "Backup" or "Backup & Restore" option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.

### How to transfer Android messages to iPhone 12/XS (Max) using SMS Backup+

You can learn how to transfer messages from Itel A05s to iPhone 12/XS (Max) without a computer using the SMS Backup+ app. It can automatically backup the SMS, call logs, MMS using a different label in Google Calendar and Gmail. Remember that MMS can’t be restored later.

**Here is how to transfer messages from Itel A05s to iPhone 12/XS (Max) with SMS Backup+:**

1. Get the Android phone and sign in to your ‘Gmail account’ and press ‘Settings’. Go to ‘Forwarding and POP/IMAP’. Now, tap ‘Enable IMAP’ and click ‘Save Changes’.
2. Download SMS Backup+ on your Itel A05s from Google Play Store and launch it. Tap ‘Connect’ choose the recently used Gmail account. Now, allow the app to backup the SMS to your Gmail account and hit ‘Backup’.

3. Now, since you’ve backed up your messages to Gmail, you can simply access and view them from any device. Simply launch Gmail with the same account, and you’ll be able to get hold of all your messages right on your iPhone 12/XS (Max).

**Note:** _The messages will be enclosed in an Email attachment. That implies you won’t be able to import your messages to your iMessage app. If you want to transfer SMS to the default messages app, try Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer. It's a one-click and reliable desktop software._
