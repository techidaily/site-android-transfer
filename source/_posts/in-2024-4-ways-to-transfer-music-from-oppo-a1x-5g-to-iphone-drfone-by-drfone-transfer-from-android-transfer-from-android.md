## Part 2: How to transfer music from Oppo A1x 5G to iPhone selectively?

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

    Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Oppo A1x 5G to iTunes as well. To do this, you need to select the “Transfer Device Media to iTunes” option from its home page.
