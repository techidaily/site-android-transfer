## Part 5. 2 Methods To Transfer Contacts From iPhone to Android

This section will discuss two methods to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android. Similarly, in this iPhone-to-Android transfer case, the iPhone synchronization method and importing VCF file method can be used to move your contact list.

### Method 1. Enable iPhone Sync Feature

You can enable the iPhone Sync feature to transfer contacts from an iPhone to an Android device. In this case, ensure the contacts option in the Gmail synchronization is toggled on. Later, the contacts are saved when you sign in with the same Google account on your Tecno Pop 7 Pro. Let's learn **how to transfer from phone to phone using this feature**:

- **Step 1.** Access the "Settings" app on your iPhone and navigate to the "Contacts" settings. Then, tap on "Accounts" and choose your Gmail account. Turn on the “Contacts” toggle switch to synchronize them.

**Note:** You can select "Add Account,” tap “Google," and input your credentials if your account has not been added yet.

- **Step 2.** Now, you have to install or access the “Google One” app on your Tecno Pop 7 Pro. Sign in and configure your Google One settings. Then, navigate to the “Sync” section and tap the “View” option.

### Method 2. Import the VCF File

Importing a VCF file is another simple method for transferring contacts. It includes a vCard creation, in which contacts are saved. Then, this card can be downloaded from an iCloud account and imported to your Tecno Pop 7 Pro. Moreover, this simple process does not involve any complicated steps to implement it. You can import a VCF file by following these simple steps.

- **Step 1.** At first, you will have to access “Settings” on your iPhone and tap your “Profile” icon at the top. After that, tap "iCloud," followed by the "Show All" option. Then,you need to toggle the “Contacts” switch to turn it on.
