## Part 2: Transfer SMS from Realme 10T 5G to iPhone using Move to iOS app

Transferring text messages from Realme 10T 5G to iPhone using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer is the best and the fastest way.

If you want to find another way to transfer messages and other stuff from Realme 10T 5G to iPhone, then Move to the iOS app can help in this task.

It is available for free at Google Play Store and is of the minuscule size of approximately 2.2 MB. One doesn’t need to wait extreme time to install the app. With Move to iOS, you will be able to set up the iOS device easily without needing to connect it with a USB cable. But there are some prerequisites that you have to fulfill before you can transfer data from Realme 10T 5G to iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) or an earlier model-

### How to transfer text messages from Android and iPhone using Move to iOS?

Want to learn how to transfer messages from android to iPhone without USB cables and computers? With the below steps, you can easily transfer messages and other data from Realme 10T 5G to iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) using Move to iOS -

Step 1: Click on the “Move Data from Android” button on the “Apps and Data” screen during the iPhone setup process. If you have already set up the Realme 10T 5G device, then you need to erase the data from Settings > General > Reset and then go to Apps and Data screen.

![transfer messages from android to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/move-data-from-android.JPG "Apps and data screen")

Step 2: On the iPhone, click “Continue” on the Move from Android screen. It will generate the 6-digit or 10-digit code.

Step 3: Now on the Android device, download and install the Move to iOS app and open it.

Step 4: Tap on “Continue” and then “Agree” on the terms and conditions screen and then “Next” on the “Find Your Code” screen.

Step 5: Enter the code generated on the iPhone in the “Enter Code” screen.

![enter code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/enter-code.JPG "enter the code to verify")

Step 6: On the Transfer Data screen, select the content to transfer and click “Next”. It will start the transfer process and will take some time to complete depending on the size of the data.

![process of transferring sms from android to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/move-to-ios.JPG "transfer to be complete in a while")

Step 7: After transferring is complete, finish the iPhone device setup process.

The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from Realme 10T 5G to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method. They can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) for the task.
