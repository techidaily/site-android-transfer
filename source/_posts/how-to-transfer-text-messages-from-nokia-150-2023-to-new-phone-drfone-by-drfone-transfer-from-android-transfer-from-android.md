Make it a habit to create separate folders for different events, locations, or time periods. This organization method helps you maintain a clear structure for your photo collection.

### Rename Your Photo

Give your photos descriptive and unique filenames that reflect either their content or context. Organizing your files by their respective labels helps you find them easily instead of relying solely on visual cues. Consider including dates, locations, or key details in the filenames to make your photos easily identifiable.

**NOTE:** By incorporating these organization techniques, you can surely enjoy your memory collection on the larger canvas of your computer screen.
