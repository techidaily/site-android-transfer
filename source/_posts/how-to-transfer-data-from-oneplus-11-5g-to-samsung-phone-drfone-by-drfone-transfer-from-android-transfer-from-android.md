This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled.

3\. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.

4\. Now, on your OnePlus 11 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.
