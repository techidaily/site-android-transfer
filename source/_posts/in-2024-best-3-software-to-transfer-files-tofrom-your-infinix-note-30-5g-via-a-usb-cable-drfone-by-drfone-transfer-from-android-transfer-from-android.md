## Part 2: Transfer Files from Infinix Note 30 5G to Other Android Devices by Nearby Share

Nearby Share is a method developed by Google to ****share files between Android phones****. It can be considered Google’s answer to Apple’s AirDrop, though, unlike AirDrop, it doesn’t require Wi-Fi. This method is available for all Android devices though you should use the latest Android OS for smoother working. Moreover, Bluetooth needs to be enabled to use this method.

### Step-by-Step Guide To Transfer Files via Nearby Share

****Step 1:**** You will need to activate “Nearby Share” on both devices first. To do that, go to the phone’s “Settings” and access the “Google” settings. Here, tap “Devices and Sharing,” and from the next appearing screen, choose “Nearby Share.”

![choose the nearby share option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/transfer-files-from-android-to-android-4.jpg)

****Step 2:**** In the “Nearby Share” screen, toggle it on and set device visibility to “Everyone.” Once you activate it on both Android devices, find and select the files you want to transfer on the old Android phone.
