## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Oppo Reno 9A to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Oppo Reno 9A Migrate if you are a Oppo Reno 9A user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Oppo Reno 9A devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Oppo Reno 9A device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Oppo Reno 9A models are now unable to run Oppo Reno 9A Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Oppo Reno 9A to iPhone besides Oppo Reno 9A Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Oppo Reno 9A Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Oppo Reno 9A to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Oppo Reno 9A and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Oppo Reno 9A and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Oppo Reno 9A device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
