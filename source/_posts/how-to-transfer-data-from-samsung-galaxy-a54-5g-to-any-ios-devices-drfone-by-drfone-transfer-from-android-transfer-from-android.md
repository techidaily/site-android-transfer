4. If it is already on and is still not working, try toggling the option on and off a few times.

Make sure that you have an active Internet connection, and that background data is switched off. The importance of checking your Internet connection before proceeding to more extreme measures for all issues cannot be ignored. The issues that may be disturbing you might be due to an issue with your device's connection to the Internet

1. Switch Off and Switch On your Data Connection.
2. Go to Settings, then go to "Data Usage" and ensure that Restricting Background Data is disabled on your device.

1. Go to Settings
2. Then tap on "Apps" or "Apps Manager," depending on your device and Android version.
3. Go to all Apps and find Contact Sync.
4. Select Clear Cache and also Clear Data.
5. This should knock the Contacts sync back to normal and ensure that your sync goes on without a hitch from there on out.

1. Go to Settings.
2. Go to Accounts, then proceed to your Google Account.
3. Select the Remove Account option

2. Tap on the menu, then tap on "Contacts to Display" option
3. Select "Only Device". Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device to display.
4. Tap on "Menu" and then on "Merge Accounts"
5. Select Google Merge. This will merge all your Contacts with Google.
6. Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting "Contacts to Display", then "All Contacts"

However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts.
