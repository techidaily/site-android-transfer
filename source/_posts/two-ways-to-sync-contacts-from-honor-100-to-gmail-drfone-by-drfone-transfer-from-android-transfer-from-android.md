## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro Using Wi-Fi

Users who want to avoid downloading apps can use the built-in file transfer app instead. All Android phones include a data transfer tool that appears when setting up a new device. Using it is incredibly straightforward, and all you need to do is follow the on-screen instructions to initiate a file transfer between your old and new phone over Wi-Fi. Here’s how:

1. Power on your new Pixel phone and tap the **Get started**button during the initial setup. Choose to restore from an old phone.

    ![transfer data to new pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-8.jpg)

2. Connect the Honor 100 device to a Wi-Fi network.
3. Choose the “**Can’t use old device**” option and sign in with your Google account.

    ![restore specific file types](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-10.jpg)

5. Follow the file transfer instructions and watch as data copies from your old Samsung to your new Pixel 8/8 Pro device.

Your new phone will notify you when the file transfer is complete, and you can continue using your brand-new device right where you left off with the Samsung one.

## Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro Using USB

If you don’t want to transfer files over a Wi-Fi network, don’t want to waste your mobile data, or wish to complete the file transfer the old-fashioned way with a USB cable, you can follow these steps to transfer data from Samsung to Pixel:

1. Turn on your new Pixel 8/8 Pro device and launch the built-in data transfer tool that appears when setting up your device.
2. Hit the **Get started** button on your Pixel phone and connect to a Wi-Fi network (this is required to initiate a data transfer, regardless of your connection).
3. Tap on **Next**when you see the “Copy apps and data” screen. Click **Next** again when prompted to use your old phone.

Give your phones a few minutes to transfer data from Samsung to Pixel, and remember that it can even take several hours, depending on your phone’s internal storage size and filled space. The built-in file transfer app will notify you once it completes everything.

## Transfer Files to Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro via PC

Using a computer as an intermediary device for transferring files is another excellent idea, and it’ll even let you organize your old phone’s data before you copy it to your new device. You’ll need to follow these steps to transfer data from your old phone to your PC and from your PC to your new Pixel 8/8 Pro device:

1. Connect your old Samsung device to your PC via USB.
2. Tap the phone’s notification and select **File Transfer**under the “Use USB for” option.
3. Access its memory through the computer’s File Explorer.
4. Select the files and folders you want to copy and transfer them to a new folder on your PC. You can then go through these files on your PC, delete what you don’t need, and organize everything before transferring the data to your new Pixel 8 device, but this is optional.

    ![copy data to the pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-14.jpg)

5. Disconnect the old phone from the computer.
6. Connect your new Pixel phone to the PC.
7. Once again, click the phone’s notification and select the **File Transfer**
8. Transfer the contents of your computer’s folder onto the new device.
9. Disconnect the new device after your files have been copied.

You’ll need to consider which types of files go into which folders. For example, you’ll need to ensure that music data goes into Android’s Music folder, pictures and videos go into Camera or DCIM folders, and documents and downloads have their respective folders, which are typical on Android.

## Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch

Another excellent option for transferring files to any Pixel phone is with Google’s Quick Switch adapters. These free OTG devices are included in every Pixel phone box and are designed to help you transfer data from an old phone to a new Pixel device.

A Quick Switch adapter connects to your Pixel phone, and you can insert a Samsung-compatible USB cable on the other end to start the transfer process.

Here’s what you’ll need to do:

1. Power on your new Pixel 8/8 Pro phone and click **Start**.
2. Plug the Quick Switch adapter into the Pixel device and connect the USB cable with the USB-A end into the Quick Switch. Connect the other end to the Samsung phone.
3. Unlock your Samsung device and click the **Copy**
4. Select the type of data you want to transfer and hit **Copy**.

5. Once the process is complete, click **Next** \> **Done**.

Before you start the file transfer process using a Quick Switch, you should ensure both devices are fully charged. Furthermore, you should also update your Samsung device to the latest software version to avoid potential transfer issues, such as data corruption or incomplete transfers.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Pixel Using Google Drive

Being an Android user requires a Google account, granting you access to 15 GB of free storage space on Google Drive, making the app an excellent way to transfer files from your old phone to your new one. Here’s how you can use it:

1. Using your old Samsung phone, navigate to **Settings**\> **Accounts and Backup**\> **Back up data** under **Google Drive**.

    ![restore from a google drive backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-17.jpg)

7. Choose the latest backup made on your Samsung phone and tap **Restore**to copy data from Samsung to Pixel.

It’s worth noting that Google Drive users aren’t limited to 15 GB of storage space, as paid plans also include 100 GB and 200 GB options for a few dollars per month, making this type of transfer incredibly efficient.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.
