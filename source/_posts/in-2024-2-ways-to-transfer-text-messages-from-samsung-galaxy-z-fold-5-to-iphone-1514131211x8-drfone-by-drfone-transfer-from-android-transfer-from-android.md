## Part 1: Is It Possible To Transfer Apps from Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 to Other Android Devices and iPhone to Android?

It is possible to transfer applications from an Android phone to another Android. There are multiple ways that Android offers to move apps between two smartphones. These include using the Google Play Store and signing in with the same Google account. Also, multiple tools and apps can assist you in this context.

That's why directly transferring apps from iPhone to Android is impossible. You must download it again from the Google Play Store on your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5.
