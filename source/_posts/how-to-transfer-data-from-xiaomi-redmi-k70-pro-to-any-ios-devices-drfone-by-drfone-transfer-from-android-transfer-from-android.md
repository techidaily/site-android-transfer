2. Tap on the menu, then tap on "Contacts to Display" option
3. Select "Only Device". Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device to display.
4. Tap on "Menu" and then on "Merge Accounts"
5. Select Google Merge. This will merge all your Contacts with Google.
6. Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting "Contacts to Display", then "All Contacts"
7. This should make all the contacts on your device to appear, and your sync problem should also be solved.

These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account. It is also worthy of note that if you want new contacts to be saved automatically to your Google account, you have to select the Google Account option when prompted on where to save the new contact, or else, the contact will not be automatically synced to your Gmail account, and you will have to create an export to add it to your Google Contacts.

Also, keep in mind that it might take a longer period of time for the contacts to synchronize to Google on a slower network connection, in deviance to a fast network connection, so you might need to exercise some patience if you're on a slower Internet connection.

It can sometimes be bewildering and baffling when people probably lose their phones, and then they complain of loss of contacts. However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts. All the methods mentioned above are easy to execute and will help you transfer contacts from the phone to Gmail in a snap.

Lastly, you can also use [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html) for smoothly exporting contacts from Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro to Gmail.
