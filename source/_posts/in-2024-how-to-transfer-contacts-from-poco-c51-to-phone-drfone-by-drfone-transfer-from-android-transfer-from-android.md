1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Poco C51 to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Poco C51 to your system. Though, to transfer music from Poco C51 to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Poco C51 to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).
3. Go to the Music folder, copy your favorite songs, and save them to your Mac. After that, you can transfer music from your Poco C51 to your Mac.

## Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Poco C51 to iPhone?

These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them. The good thing about these streaming services is that you can access your music from multiple devices. For instance, let’s consider the example of Spotify.

Once you have created a playlist on your Spotify account, you can access it from any other device. You can even access your music by visiting its website because it will be stored on Spotify’s server and not your device itself.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-transfer streaming music](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-4.jpg)

If you are moving from an Android to an iPhone, you can follow these steps to ensure your Spotify music won’t be lost.

- Launch Spotify on your Poco C51 and go to the Playlist tab. From here, you can create a playlist. Later, you can add your favorite songs to this playlist as well. You can even create multiple playlists on the app.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-create a playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-5.jpg)

- Afterward, unlock your iPhone and go to the App store. Look for the music streaming app and download it on your phone.
- Once you log in to your Spotify account using your credentials, you can access “My Music” and access all your saved playlists.

Let's discuss another scenario in which we will transfer the contact list from an Android to an iPhone. If you want to switch from Poco C51 to a new iPhone, you will probably need an effective method to transfer your phone numbers. In this section, we will discuss two simple and quick ways to **how do I transfer contacts from phone to phone:**

### Method 1. Sync Google Account

Android users can back up their phone's data to Google Drive. Also, an Android phone's "Google Contacts" app saves the contact information to their linked Google account. The same account can be logged in a new iPhone, where they can be restored. Follow the simple guide to sync your Google account with the updated contact information:

- **Step 1.** First, open the “Google Contacts” app on your Poco C51 and tap the "Profile" icon at the top right corner. Following this, head to the "Contacts settings" and choose the "Google Contacts sync settings" option.
