### Method 2: iTunes

Using iTunes to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad involves a slightly indirect process. The variance in operating systems is the primary reason for this distinction. iTunes is primarily tailored for iOS devices; however, with supplemental steps, it can be utilized to transfer videos from an Android device to an iPad. Here's a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:

- **Step 1.** Connect your Honor X50i and copy or move the desired videos from your Honor X50i to your computer. Next, launch the most recent version of iTunes on your computer to import the videos transferred from your Honor X50i.

![launch itunes on computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-videos-from-android-to-ipad-14.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Access the "File" menu and choose either "Add File to Library" or "Add Folder to Library." Proceed by locating and selecting the transferred videos to import them into your iTunes library.
