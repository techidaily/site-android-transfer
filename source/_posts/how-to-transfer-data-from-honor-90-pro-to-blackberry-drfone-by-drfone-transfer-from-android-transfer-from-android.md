In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to **transfer data from Honor 90 Pro to iPhone 15** conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.


## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Honor 90 Pro to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Honor 90 Pro device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Honor 90 Pro to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Honor 90 Pro to iPhone 15 conveniently.

As you know the SIM card itself can hold a certain number of contacts, depending on the carrier and phone make and model.

1. Open the ‘Contacts’ app and click on ‘More’. Go to the ‘Import/Export’ or simply ‘Export Contacts’ option there.
2. Click on ‘Export to SIM’ or ‘SIM card’ and then select the source of contacts i.e. ‘Phone’/’WhatsApp’/’Google’/’Messenger’.

1. Then hit ‘Export’ and ‘Continue’ afterward.
2. Now, open the SIM card slot of your Honor 90 Pro and unmount the SIM. Insert it on your iPhone XS/11 and turn it on. You can find the contacts on your iPhone.

**Note:** _Though, it’s rare nowadays. In case you happen to own a very old SIM card and your Honor 90 Pro supported the size. You might need to cut it to fit the iPhone XS/11’s micro-SIM slot._
