## Mobogenie Android USB File Transfer

**Advantages:**

- Uninstall stock apps in batches.
- Easy-to-use interface.
- Easily download and manage apps.
- Easily transfer multiple files from your PC to your Android, and vice versa.
- Free of charge.

**Disadvantages:**

Once you have completed this process, you will be taken to the home screen:

![bluetooth android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/moborobo-home.jpg)

As with other data management software, you can download and install apps onto your Itel A05s from your PC. The advantage of this is that apps can be downloaded quickly, and also without costing you in terms of data roaming charges.

![usb android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/download-app-with-mobogenie.jpg)

A neat feature is the ability to uninstall apps that came preloaded on the phone as often we find ourselves with apps that we never use that we cannot delete.

![use transfer android file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/uninstall-app-with-mobogenie.jpg)

The transfer of photo files is straightforward, and several photos can be selected from your computer to import onto your device at once, or vice versa.

![usb to android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/transfer-photos-with-mobogenie.jpg)

**Features:**

- Free.
- Support wireless connection of devices on the same network (although temperamental).

- Simple to use.

**Overview:**

Download MoboRobo and install this Android USB file transfer tool on your computer. Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your Itel A05s with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your Itel A05s as well.

Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.

![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Itel A05s with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

Switching to a brand-new smartphone requires plenty of work. You first need to set up the new device and configure your digital accounts. But with regard to data transfer and file synchronization, you don’t have to worry a lot. There are many ways you can try to quickly **transfer data from Itel A05s to iPhone 15.**

In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to **transfer data from Itel A05s to iPhone 15** conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.

## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Itel A05s to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Itel A05s device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Itel A05s to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Itel A05s to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## Part 2: How to transfer music from Itel A05s to iPhone selectively?

Another user-friendly way to learn how to send music from Itel A05s to iPhone is by using [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html). A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit, it can be a complete Android device manager. You can transfer your data between Android and computer and from an Android to an iOS device.

Since it is a complete Android phone manager, you can use it to transfer all the other kinds of data (like photos, videos, contacts, messages, and more) from one source to another. Unlike Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer that moves all the music files at once, you can perform a selective data transfer. The interface will provide a preview of your data so that you can choose the files you wish to move. To learn how to transfer music from Itel A05s to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

2. Connect both Android phones and iPhone to software and let them be detected automatically. From the top-left option, make sure you have selected your Itel A05s as a default/source device. The interface will provide its snapshot with some shortcuts.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-select your Itel A05s as a source device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-files-quickly-to-android-1.png)

3. To manage the music files stored on the Android device, go to the “Music” tab on the interface. Here, you can view all music files, podcasts, audiobooks, songs, etc., listed in different categories.
4. Choose the files and then select the export button on the toolbar. From here, select the connected iPhone as a source.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on the export icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/android-transfer-export-music-01.jpg)

5. Wait a moment and let the application automatically transfer your selected music files from your Itel A05s to your iPhone.

    Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Itel A05s to iTunes as well. To do this, you need to select the “Transfer Device Media to iTunes” option from its home page. This will launch a pop-up window and let you move your music files from the Android device to iTunes directly.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-Transfer Device Media to iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/mac-android-transfer-to-itunes-01.jpg)

In this way, you can selectively transfer music from Itel A05s to iPhone in a hassle-free manner.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Itel A05s to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Itel A05s to your system. Though, to transfer music from Itel A05s to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Itel A05s to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).
3. Go to the Music folder, copy your favorite songs, and save them to your Mac. After that, you can transfer music from your Itel A05s to your Mac.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iPhone-Go to the Music folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg)

4. Great! You are halfway there. Launch iTunes on your Mac and add the newly transferred music to it. You can drag and drop it from the Finder to iTunes. Alternatively, you can also go to its options and click on “Add files to Library”. In this way, you can manually add new music to your iTunes library.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-Add files to Library](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-2.jpg)

5. Once you have transferred the newly added music to iTunes, connect your target iPhone to the system, and let iTunes detect it automatically.
6. Select your iPhone from the Itel A05s devices and go to its “Music” tab. From here, you can enable the “Sync Music” options. Select the playlists and songs you wish to move and click on the “Apply” button to initiate the process.

## Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Itel A05s to iPhone?

These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them. The good thing about these streaming services is that you can access your music from multiple devices. For instance, let’s consider the example of Spotify.

Once you have created a playlist on your Spotify account, you can access it from any other device. You can even access your music by visiting its website because it will be stored on Spotify’s server and not your device itself.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-transfer streaming music](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-4.jpg)

If you are moving from an Android to an iPhone, you can follow these steps to ensure your Spotify music won’t be lost.

- Launch Spotify on your Itel A05s and go to the Playlist tab. From here, you can create a playlist. Later, you can add your favorite songs to this playlist as well. You can even create multiple playlists on the app.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-create a playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-5.jpg)

- Afterward, unlock your iPhone and go to the App store. Look for the music streaming app and download it on your phone.
- Once you log in to your Spotify account using your credentials, you can access “My Music” and access all your saved playlists.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-access all your saved playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg)

The same drill can be followed for all the other streaming services as well. While you can sync your music using these streaming services, the songs you have made available offline will not be listed here. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have saved them in a playlist beforehand.

When you know how to move music from Itel A05s to iPhone, you can easily make this transition. Go ahead and pick a preferred option to transfer music from Itel A05s to iPhone. For a one-click transfer of data, you can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/), while to make a selective transfer, you can try [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html). Both of these are user-friendly and reliable tools that will come handy to you on numerous occasions.
