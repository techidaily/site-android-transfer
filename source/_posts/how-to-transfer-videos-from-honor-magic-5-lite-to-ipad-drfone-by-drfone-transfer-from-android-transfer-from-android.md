## Part 3. How to Do Honor Magic 5 Lite to iPhone Data Transfer Using Dropbox/Google Drive

Another method for **Honor Magic 5 Lite to iPhone transfer** is using Cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive.

Users can upload and store their files to the cloud, making them available for download on other devices.

Either Google Drive or Dropbox follows similar steps for data transfer. The difference between them is in the amount of free storage each service provides. Notably, Google Drive provides 15GB of free storage, while Dropbox offers 2GB.

Follow these steps on how to do a Honor Magic 5 Lite to iPhone transfer via cloud storage services.

- **Step 1:** Install and set up Dropbox/Google Drive:

Begin by installing the Dropbox or Google Drive app on both your Honor Magic 5 Lite and iPhone. Create accounts if you don't have them already.
