### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:
