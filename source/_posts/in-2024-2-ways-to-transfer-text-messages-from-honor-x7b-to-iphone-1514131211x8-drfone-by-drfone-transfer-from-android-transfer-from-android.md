## Part 3. How to Do Honor X7b to iPhone Data Transfer Using Dropbox/Google Drive

Another method for **Honor X7b to iPhone transfer** is using Cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Both Dropbox and Google Drive serve as virtual storage spaces accessible from any device with an internet connection.

Follow these steps on how to do a Honor X7b to iPhone transfer via cloud storage services.

- **Step 1:** Install and set up Dropbox/Google Drive:

Begin by installing the Dropbox or Google Drive app on both your Honor X7b and iPhone. Create accounts if you don't have them already.

- **Step 2:** Upload the files from Honor X7b
