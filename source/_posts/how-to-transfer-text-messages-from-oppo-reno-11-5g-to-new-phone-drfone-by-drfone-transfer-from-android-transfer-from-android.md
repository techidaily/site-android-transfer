![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-app and data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg) ![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move data from android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-7.jpg)

The next step is to take your Oppo Reno 11 5G to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.

- **Step 2:** Switch to your Oppo Reno 11 5G, open the Google Play Store, and search for the ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- **Step 3:** Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.
- **Step 4:** At this point, tap Continue on both your iOS and Android devices.

- **Step 6:** Before the transfer starts, you will be asked several questions, like do you want to transfer Google Account information, Bookmarks, etc. Now, since you only wish to videos and photos, deselect the other options except ‘Camera Roll.’

The above process to **transfer pictures from Oppo Reno 11 5G to iPhone** is suitable for mobile users who are unwilling to invest money in software. However, the method is not perfect because it is time-consuming. The transaction can neither be done quickly nor can it be done with a single click.
