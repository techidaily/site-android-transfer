## Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Tecno Phantom V Flip to iPad/iPhone

Transferring photos from your Tecno Phantom V Flip to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes.

Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.
