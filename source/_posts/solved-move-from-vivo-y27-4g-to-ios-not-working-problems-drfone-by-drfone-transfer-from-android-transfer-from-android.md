## Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists

Users can learn to use the Move to iOS app quickly. However, they will occasionally experience problems while using this tool. If the app runs into errors, you will encounter some problems.

- **Move to iOS no code.**

These steps will help you get the Move to iOS code;

When setting up your iPhone, tap on the move data from the android option. Then, launch the Move to ios app on your android device and tap continue. You will see the find you code screen; tap on the .next' button to continue.

Tap on the continue button on your iOS device and wait for a ten-digit code to appear.

Once you receive the code on your iPhone, enter it on the android device and wait for the Vivo Y27 4G devices to connect. Select all the content you want to move and click Next.

Once the loading bar on the iOS device is done, tap on the 'Done' button on your android device. Proceed to set up your iOS device using the onscreen steps.

If you are not receiving any code on your iOS device, you can fix it by ensuring the Wi-Fi is always on throughout the process. You can also reboot your devices if the error is temporary.

- **Move to iOS could not communicate correctly with the Vivo Y27 4G devices.**

To avoid this Move to iOS error, ensure both devices run on updated operating systems, i.e., android 4.0 or later and iOS 9 or later. The phones must have enough power, and lastly, ensure that you turn off background apps to avoid notifications during the transfer process.

- **Move to iOS stuck on preparing/transferring.**

You are transferring your android data to iOS, but the process is stuck on the transferring page. The problem is related to Wi-Fi connections. Should the Wi-Fi disconnect for a few seconds, the transfer process stops. Other distractions on android such as calls, switching to sleep mode, or other background operations might also cause the Move to iOS error.

- **Move to iOS takes forever/slow.**

The length of time taken to transfer data from android to iOS depends on the size of the data and Wi-Fi connection. To speed up the transfer, check your Wi-Fi connection, delete unnecessary data from the android device, or restart the transfer if it takes too long.

- **Move to iOS Wi-Fi disconnect.**

Wi-Fi drops will obviously interfere with the transfer process. To avoid this error, you can reset your router and the network and turn off smart switching and airplane mode.

- **Move to iOS interrupted**

If the Move to iOS process is interrupted, you can fix it by restarting the phone, check your network connections on both devices, turn off the smart network swath on android and turn on the airplane mode.

- **Move to iOS, not connecting devices.**

The circumstances can be frustrating as the transfer process will not be completed successfully. But what is the solution to all these problems? We will discuss the solutions to move to iOS not working in the later sections of this article.

### Tip 1: Restart both your devices

Restarting your devices is the essential thing to do when troubleshooting the Move to iOS problems. It is a great way o eliminate minor issues during data transfer from android to iOS devices. The process can resolve the Move to iOS stuck on connecting to iPhone issues. A simple restart will eliminate the bugs and any cached error in the Vivo Y27 4G devices.

### Tip 2: Clear all running apps

It is recommended to avoid using the android device o run applications when using the Move to iOS app. Since the app runs in the foreground, you should ensure all other apps in the android are disabled before starting the data transfer process. Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on

Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone's private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.

### Tip 4: Plug both devices to power

You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Vivo Y27 4G devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.

### Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode

When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.

The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 6: Check the storage requirement

Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don't need to transfer from your android device before getting started.

### Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer

Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.

### Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices

You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store. Generally, the app runs on Android 4.0 and above while transferring data to iOS 9.0 or later devices.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization

Turning off the battery optimization on both your Android and iOS device is a requirement when using the Move to iOS tool. The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode. Therefore you should ensure the feature is closed from the settings of your android device.

## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Vivo Y27 4G to iPhone

Itâ€™s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. Itâ€™s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Vivo Y27 4G device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. Thatâ€™s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiverâ€™s device does not support the data youâ€™re trying to send. But donâ€™t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Vivo Y27 4G to iPhone 15 if your first try doesnâ€™t work out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiverâ€™s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. Itâ€™s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. Itâ€™s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But donâ€™t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Vivo Y27 4G to iPhone 15 conveniently.
