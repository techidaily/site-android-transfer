Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Motorola Edge 40 Neo to iPhone besides Motorola Edge 40 Neo Migrate.

ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Motorola Edge 40 Neo and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Motorola Edge 40 Neo and iPhone devices

On your Motorola Edge 40 Neo device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

![USB android file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg)

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Motorola Edge 40 Neo with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
