## How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly

Since Motorola Edge 40 Neo is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Motorola Edge 40 Neo, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Motorola Edge 40 Neo to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Motorola Edge 40 Neo to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Motorola Edge 40 Neo Migrate if you are a Motorola Edge 40 Neo user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Motorola Edge 40 Neo devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Motorola Edge 40 Neo device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Motorola Edge 40 Neo models are now unable to run Motorola Edge 40 Neo Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Motorola Edge 40 Neo to iPhone besides Motorola Edge 40 Neo Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Motorola Edge 40 Neo Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Motorola Edge 40 Neo to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Motorola Edge 40 Neo and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Motorola Edge 40 Neo and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Motorola Edge 40 Neo device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device will initiate a search for nearby devices.
