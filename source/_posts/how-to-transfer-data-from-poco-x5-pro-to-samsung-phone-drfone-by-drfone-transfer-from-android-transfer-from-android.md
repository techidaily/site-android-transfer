2. Now, open the SIM card slot of your Poco X5 Pro and unmount the SIM. Insert it on your iPhone XS/11 and turn it on. You can find the contacts on your iPhone.

**Note:** _Though, it’s rare nowadays. In case you happen to own a very old SIM card and your Poco X5 Pro supported the size. You might need to cut it to fit the iPhone XS/11’s micro-SIM slot._
