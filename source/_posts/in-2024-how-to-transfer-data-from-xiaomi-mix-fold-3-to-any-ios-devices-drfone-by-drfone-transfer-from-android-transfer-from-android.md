If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
