### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Itel A60 device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Itel A60 to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Itel A60 to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## 5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Itel A60 to iPhone 15

Step 7: After transferring is complete, finish the iPhone device setup process.

The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from Itel A60 to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method. They can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) for the task.

## Part 6: Clone Itel A60 Phone Using Bluetooth

Using Bluetooth for cloning an Android phone is not the most efficient method. It is more suitable for transferring specific files than creating a comprehensive clone.

1\. On both Android devices, turn on Bluetooth and pair the Itel A60 devices. Navigate to the file you want to send on the source device, tap "Share," and select "Bluetooth."

2\. Now, choose the targeted device to send the file. Move to the other device and "Accept" the incoming file transfer.
