**Step 2.** Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.

Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.

**Step 3.** The final step is to head to the File Manager app on your phone or go to your Music Player, select the music file you wish to transfer, and then click on your device's Share button or logo.

Here, scroll until you see the “Bluetooth” option. You will be immediately prompted to select the Vivo Y02T device to share with, click the earlier paired device name, and then click on “Accept” on the other device.

This is how you can transfer music files from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth.

## Part 4. How to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices using NFC?

NFC or Near Field Communication is another wireless means to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices. Although, unlike Bluetooth, this method requires contact between the two devices making the transfer.

**Below are the steps on how to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices using NFC.**

**Step 1.** First, enable NFC connection on both the Vivo Y02T devices between which you want to transfer the music files. To switch on NFC on Android, go to Phone’s “Settings” and click on “More Settings” under “Wireless and Network” options. Now click on the NFC button to ensure that it is switched On. Do the same on the other Android device as well.

**Step 2.** Before you begin to transfer, you need to touch the back of both devices (whose NFC has already been turned on), you will notice that both devices vibrate upon a successful connection. This means you can now start transferring your music files.

**Step 3.** After connecting both the Vivo Y02T devices, you will be provided with media options of files that can be transferred. In this case, select the Music files and then click on “Transfer” to send the music files via NFC.

## Part 5. How to transfer music from Vivo Y02T to Other Android Devices using Google Play Music?

Google Play Music is a free Music streaming service provided by Google and available for all users with a Google account. Follow these steps to transfer music files to an Android phone using Google play.

Note: You need a Google account to be able to make use of this service

**Step 1.** Open Google Play Music on your computer and sign in with your already existing Google account details (Same as on 1<sup>st</sup> Android Device).
