If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Vivo S17t to your system.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Vivo S17t to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).
