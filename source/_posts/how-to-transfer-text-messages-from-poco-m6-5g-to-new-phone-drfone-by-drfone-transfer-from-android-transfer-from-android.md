## How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly

Since Poco M6 5G is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Poco M6 5G, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems. But it doesn't mean impossible!

If you're switching to an iPhone and need to transfer all your data, this article has you covered. We will look at ways to facilitate smooth **Poco M6 5G to iPhone transfer** while ensuring your valuable information transfers across these devices with no problem.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Poco M6 5G to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Poco M6 5G Migrate if you are a Poco M6 5G user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Poco M6 5G devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Poco M6 5G device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Poco M6 5G models are now unable to run Poco M6 5G Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Poco M6 5G to iPhone besides Poco M6 5G Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Poco M6 5G Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Poco M6 5G to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Poco M6 5G and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Poco M6 5G and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Poco M6 5G device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Poco M6 5G device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Poco M6 5G device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Poco M6 5G phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

![Poco M6 5G to iPhone transfer with ShareIt.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/transfer-data-from-motorola-to-iphone-1.jpg)

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Poco M6 5G to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Poco M6 5G to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones. You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Poco M6 5G phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code
- On your Poco M6 5G, a screen will appear to request a 6-10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Poco M6 5G device to make a secure connection between the two devices.

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.
