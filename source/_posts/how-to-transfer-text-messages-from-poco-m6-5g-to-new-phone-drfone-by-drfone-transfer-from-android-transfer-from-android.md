## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Poco M6 5G to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Poco M6 5G Migrate if you are a Poco M6 5G user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Poco M6 5G devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Poco M6 5G device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Poco M6 5G models are now unable to run Poco M6 5G Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Poco M6 5G to iPhone besides Poco M6 5G Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Poco M6 5G Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Poco M6 5G to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Poco M6 5G and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Poco M6 5G device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Poco M6 5G device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Poco M6 5G device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Poco M6 5G phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.
