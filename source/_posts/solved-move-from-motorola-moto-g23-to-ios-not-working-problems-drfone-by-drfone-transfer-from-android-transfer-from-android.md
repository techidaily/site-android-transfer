## Part 2: 9 Tips about moving to iOS not working problems

Even though Move to iOS is a useful tool for android users willing to transfer content to the iOS device, there are several instances where it fails to work correctly. The app will show a message indicating the type of error you are experiencing during the transfer process.

Most of the 'move to iOS' problems are related to Wi-Fi connection issues, android and iOS versions, space requirements, connection optimizers, and application issues. Nevertheless, you will need to find a solution to these problems to transfer your data successfully from android to iOS devices. This section will discuss possible solutions to the errors that occasionally appear when moving android data to iOS devices.

### Tip 1: Restart both your devices

The process can resolve the Move to iOS stuck on connecting to iPhone issues. A simple restart will eliminate the bugs and any cached error in the Motorola Moto G23 devices.

### Tip 2: Clear all running apps

It is recommended to avoid using the android device o run applications when using the Move to iOS app. Since the app runs in the foreground, you should ensure all other apps in the android are disabled before starting the data transfer process. Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.

### Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on

Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 4: Plug both devices to power

You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Motorola Moto G23 devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode

When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.

The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.

### Tip 6: Check the storage requirement

Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don't need to transfer from your android device before getting started.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer

Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.

### Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices

You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store. Generally, the app runs on Android 4.0 and above while transferring data to iOS 9.0 or later devices.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization

Turning off the battery optimization on both your Android and iOS device is a requirement when using the Move to iOS tool. The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode. Therefore you should ensure the feature is closed from the settings of your android device.

## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Motorola Moto G23 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Motorola Moto G23 Migrate if you are a Motorola Moto G23 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Motorola Moto G23 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Motorola Moto G23 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Motorola Moto G23 models are now unable to run Motorola Moto G23 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Motorola Moto G23 to iPhone besides Motorola Moto G23 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Motorola Moto G23 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Motorola Moto G23 to iPhone transfer**. ShareIt is a popular cross-platform file-sharing application known for its simplicity and efficiency. To use it, you'll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Motorola Moto G23 and iPhone.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Motorola Moto G23 and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Motorola Moto G23 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Motorola Moto G23 device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Motorola Moto G23 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.

- **Step 4:** Transfer the files to the iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click "Receive." This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files. When your Motorola Moto G23 phone detects your iPhone, tap on the iPhone’s avatar to proceed with the transfer.

### Solution 2. Move Contents from Motorola Moto G23 to iPhone via Apps & Data

Another good alternative of **Motorola Moto G23 to iPhone transfer app** is Move to iOS. This Move to iOS app is designed by Apple specifically for users moving from Android devices to iPhones. You can download it from the Google Play Store. Then, you can transfer the data by accessing Apps & Data on the iPhone.

However, if you have been using your iPhone for a while, you must reset your iPhone first to proceed with this method. It can be done by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. After resetting, your iPhone will be going back to the initial setup.

For more details, follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1:** Setup your iPhone

    Power up your new iPhone and progress through the initial setup until you get into the "Apps & Data" screen. Select the option that reads "Move Data from Android."

- **Step 2:** Agree to Terms and Conditions
- Open Move to iOS on your Motorola Moto G23 phone. Review the terms and conditions and press "Agree" to proceed.

- **Step 3:** Enter the Code
- On your Motorola Moto G23, a screen will appear to request a 6-10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Motorola Moto G23 device to make a secure connection between the two devices.

- **Step 4:** Select Content to Transfer
- Next, choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Tap "Continue" to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.

- **Step 5:** Transfer complete.
