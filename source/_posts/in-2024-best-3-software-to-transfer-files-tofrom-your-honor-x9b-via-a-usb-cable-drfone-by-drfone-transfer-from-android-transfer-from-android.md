As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Honor X9b with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

## Part 3. How to transfer music from Honor X9b to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?

Bluetooth transfer is one of the oldest methods that can be used to transfer music from Honor X9b to Other Android Devices, and it is a simple way to make use of it.

**Here are the steps to follow to know how to transfer music from Honor X9b to Other Android Devices.**

**Step 1.** There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your Honor X9b

**Method 1:** The first method is to swipe from top to down on your Honor X9b to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.

**Method 2:** Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your Honor X9b, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.
