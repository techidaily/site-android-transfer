## Simple Reminders to Copy Contacts From Vivo Y36 to iPhone Smoothly

It’s true to say that the five data transfer methods above are safe and effective. But generally speaking, we can’t deny that any process that involves the migration of data is sensitive in nature. That’s why it’s important to prepare both devices before officially initiating the data transfer process. Here are some reminders you need to keep in mind before you export contacts from Vivo Y36 to iPhone.

- Make sure your iPhone is fully charged and carrying enough internal storage.
