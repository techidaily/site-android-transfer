You will learn how to transfer contacts from the old device to the new one easily and smoothly.

## Part I: How to Transfer Contacts from Honor X7b to Other Android Devices via Bluetooth?

This method works if you are not trading in your old smartphone to offset the cost of the new, as to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth you will require both devices present and in close proximity, a few feet away at best. There are advantages to transferring contacts using Bluetooth, such as no need for using the internet, going through any other hoops, or opening special apps! Everything you need to share contacts from one Android phone to another is built right into your phone! Now, to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, you must first pair the two devices together so as to allow for seamless contacts transfer.

### I.I: Pairing Two Android Devices Together

Here’s how to pair your old and new phone together via Bluetooth:

Step 1: On your old and new devices, go to Settings, then Bluetooth

Step 2: Make sure Bluetooth is “On” on both of them

![initiate pairing process on either device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-2.jpg)

Step 5: A prompt to pair with the new phone will come on the other device as well. For your device, make sure that the PIN is the same on both devices to ensure the security of the connection. This PIN is generated afresh and is unique, so the PIN in the image is not the PIN you will see on your devices. Tap Pair on your old device to pair the two devices together using Bluetooth.

Step 6: After pairing is complete, both devices will show under paired devices on each other:

![old device showing paired android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-3.jpg)

And that’s how simple it is to pair devices to each other using Bluetooth!

### I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth

Here is how to transfer contacts from one Android to another, easily, using Bluetooth:

Step 1: Go to Phone on your old phone and select the Contacts tab

![export contacts from old android to new](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-4.jpg)

This particular option can vary by your phone model and Android flavor, this is on Android 7 running on Motorola G4 Play. If you are unable to find a way to select contacts or share contacts in the Phone app on your phone, use the Contacts app on your phone for the same effect.

Step 3: A popup will emerge:

![select share all contacts to transfer contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-5.jpg)

Select Share All Contacts.

Step 4: When you do that, this will come up:

![select bluetooth as the method to share with](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-6.jpg)

Select Bluetooth in the Share With menu. You may select Always or Just Once and proceed.

![receive contacts on new device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-8.jpg)

And that is how to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth!

## Part II: Other Methods to Transfer Contacts from Honor X7b to Other Android Devices

What are other ways to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another? Glad you asked. Because there are other ways to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another that do not use Bluetooth and can be both seamless and more powerful than the Bluetooth method, depending on your tastes and needs.

### II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account

This is another method to transfer your contacts on one Android device and restore them on another Android device. Here’s how to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Google Sync:

Step 1: Go to Settings on your old device

Step 2: Tap Accounts

Step 3: Tap the account you want to transfer contacts from

Step 4: Make sure that there is a checkmark next to Contacts, or, in other words, Contacts sync is enabled/ toggled.

![enable contacts sync in google account settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-9.jpg)

Now, Google will sync your contacts from the Honor X7b device onto the cloud, and your new device signed into the same Google Account will automatically download the contacts.

### II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps

Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Honor X7b to iOS.

There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.

Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device

Step 2: Keep the Honor X7b devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Honor X7b devices are in different rooms or too far away.

Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Honor X7b devices

Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android

Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device

Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices

Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.

Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.

Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.

That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.

**Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods**

It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.

In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Honor X7b devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Honor X7b to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.
