![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition to Other Android Devices-by NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg)

Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.

NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.

1\. On your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

![Transfer Photos from Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg)

This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.

![Transfer data from Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg)

2\. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.

To Transfer Photos from your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.

1\. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.

2\. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.

## Part 1: Is It Possible To Transfer Apps from Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition to Other Android Devices and iPhone to Android?

It is possible to transfer applications from an Android phone to another Android. There are multiple ways that Android offers to move apps between two smartphones. These include using the Google Play Store and signing in with the same Google account. Also, multiple tools and apps can assist you in this context.

By contrast, it is not feasible to **transfer apps to a new Android phone** from an iPhone. That's mainly because of the different operating software in the two devices. The applications downloaded in iOS are not compatible with Android. Additionally, Google Play Store does not support these iOS applications. That's why directly transferring apps from iPhone to Android is impossible. You must download it again from the Google Play Store on your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition.
