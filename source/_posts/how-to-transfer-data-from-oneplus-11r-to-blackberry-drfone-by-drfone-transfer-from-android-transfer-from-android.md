### How to transfer Android messages to iPhone 12/XS (Max) using Move to iOS app

The first method to transfer text messages from OnePlus 11R to iPhone 12/XS (Max) is using the official Move to iOS app from Apple. Message history, call logs, contacts, web bookmarks, apps, etc. can be transferred from your Android to any iOS device. Though, I have noticed the app was acting strangely during data transfer. My Wi-Fi got some issues, and Move to iOS couldn’t properly complete the transfer.

**Guide for Move to iOS** **to transfer messages from OnePlus 11R to iPhone 12/XS (Max)**

1. Download, install, and launch Move to iOS on your OnePlus 11R.
2. Get the iPhone 12/XS (Max) and configure the setup and then connect to Wi-Fi. Browse to the ‘Apps & Data’ option, click ‘Move Data from Android’ thereafter. Click the ‘Continue’ button and note the passcode.

3. On your OnePlus 11R, click ‘Continue’ and then press ‘Agree’. When prompted for a passcode, enter the one you got from iPhone 12/XS (Max).

4. Ensure that the Android phone is also connected to Wi-Fi. Now, click on ‘Messages’ from the ‘Data Transfer’ option. Click ‘Next’ and wait a while to finish the data transfer. Hit the ‘Done’ button afterward once the iPhone 12/XS (Max) gets synched with these messages, set up your iCloud account, and view the messages.

### How to transfer Android messages to iPhone 12/XS (Max) using SMS Backup+

You can learn how to transfer messages from OnePlus 11R to iPhone 12/XS (Max) without a computer using the SMS Backup+ app. It can automatically backup the SMS, call logs, MMS using a different label in Google Calendar and Gmail. Remember that MMS can’t be restored later.

**Here is how to transfer messages from OnePlus 11R to iPhone 12/XS (Max) with SMS Backup+:**

1. Get the Android phone and sign in to your ‘Gmail account’ and press ‘Settings’. Go to ‘Forwarding and POP/IMAP’. Now, tap ‘Enable IMAP’ and click ‘Save Changes’.
2. Download SMS Backup+ on your OnePlus 11R from Google Play Store and launch it. Tap ‘Connect’ choose the recently used Gmail account. Now, allow the app to backup the SMS to your Gmail account and hit ‘Backup’.

    ![transfer messages from android to iPhone XS (Max) using sms backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/sms-backup.jpg)

3. Now, since you’ve backed up your messages to Gmail, you can simply access and view them from any device. Simply launch Gmail with the same account, and you’ll be able to get hold of all your messages right on your iPhone 12/XS (Max).

**Note:** _The messages will be enclosed in an Email attachment. That implies you won’t be able to import your messages to your iMessage app. If you want to transfer SMS to the default messages app, try Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer. It's a one-click and reliable desktop software._
