As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.

## Part 3. How to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?

Bluetooth transfer is one of the oldest methods that can be used to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to Other Android Devices, and it is a simple way to make use of it.

**Here are the steps to follow to know how to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to Other Android Devices.**

**Step 1.** There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your Xiaomi Redmi A2+

**Method 1:** The first method is to swipe from top to down on your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.

**Method 2:** Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your Xiaomi Redmi A2+, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.

**Step 2.** Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.

Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.

**Step 3.** The final step is to head to the File Manager app on your phone or go to your Music Player, select the music file you wish to transfer, and then click on your device's Share button or logo.

Here, scroll until you see the “Bluetooth” option. You will be immediately prompted to select the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device to share with, click the earlier paired device name, and then click on “Accept” on the other device.

This is how you can transfer music files from Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth.
