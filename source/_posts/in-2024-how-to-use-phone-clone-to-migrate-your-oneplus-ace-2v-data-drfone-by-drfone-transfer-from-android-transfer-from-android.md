## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.

To help you out, we’ve prepared the top seven methods for handling data transfers from Samsung to Google Pixel, which include the built-in data transfer tool during device setup, USB cables, Quick Switch adapter, Google Drive, email, and a dedicated third-party app – Wondershare Dr.Fone.
