As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts.

Make sure that you have an active Internet connection, and that background data is switched off.

1. Switch Off and Switch On your Data Connection.

3. Go to all Apps and find Contact Sync.
4. Select Clear Cache and also Clear Data.

3. Select "Only Device". Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device to display.
4. Tap on "Menu" and then on "Merge Accounts"

6. Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting "Contacts to Display", then "All Contacts"

These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account.

However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts.
