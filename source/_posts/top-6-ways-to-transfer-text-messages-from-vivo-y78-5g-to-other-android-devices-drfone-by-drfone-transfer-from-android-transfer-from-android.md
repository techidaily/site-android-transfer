The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from Vivo Y78 5G to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method.
