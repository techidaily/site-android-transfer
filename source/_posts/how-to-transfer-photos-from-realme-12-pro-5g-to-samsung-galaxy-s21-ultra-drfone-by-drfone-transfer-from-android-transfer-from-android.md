## Part 2: Transfer Files from Realme 12 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices by Nearby Share

Nearby Share is a method developed by Google to ****share files between Android phones****. It can be considered Google’s answer to Apple’s AirDrop, though, unlike AirDrop, it doesn’t require Wi-Fi. This method is available for all Android devices though you should use the latest Android OS for smoother working. Moreover, Bluetooth needs to be enabled to use this method.
