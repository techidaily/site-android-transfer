## Can I Transfer iPod Music to Android?

Apple's ecosystem may be renowned for its exclusivity, but with the right methods, you can seamlessly bridge the gap between your iPod and an Android device.

One of the most straightforward ways to transfer music from your iPod to an Android device is by using Bluetooth. It's worth noting that Bluetooth transfer capability is present in all iPod Touch models but not in older iPod models.

**Step 2:** Pair the Poco C51 devices.

Search for available Bluetooth devices on your Poco C51, and select your iPod from the list. Likewise, confirm the pairing request on your iPod.
