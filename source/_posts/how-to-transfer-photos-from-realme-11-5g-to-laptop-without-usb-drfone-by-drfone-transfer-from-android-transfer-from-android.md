## Simple Reminders to Copy Contacts From Realme 11 5G to iPhone Smoothly

It’s true to say that the five data transfer methods above are safe and effective. But generally speaking, we can’t deny that any process that involves the migration of data is sensitive in nature.

Here are some reminders you need to keep in mind before you export contacts from Realme 11 5G to iPhone.
