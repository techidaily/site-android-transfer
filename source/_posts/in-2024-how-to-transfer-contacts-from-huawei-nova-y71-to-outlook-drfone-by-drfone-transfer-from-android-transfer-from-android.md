## Part 1. How to Transfer Content from Huawei Nova Y71 to iPhone Directly

You must be familiar with Huawei Nova Y71 Migrate if you are a Huawei Nova Y71 user. It is a solution for seamless data transfer used in Huawei Nova Y71 devices. With this app, you can transfer data from your Huawei Nova Y71 device to others, such as iPhones.

However, most of the latest Huawei Nova Y71 models are now unable to run Huawei Nova Y71 Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Huawei Nova Y71 to iPhone besides Huawei Nova Y71 Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Huawei Nova Y71 Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Huawei Nova Y71 to iPhone transfer**.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Huawei Nova Y71 and iPhone devices

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Huawei Nova Y71 device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.
