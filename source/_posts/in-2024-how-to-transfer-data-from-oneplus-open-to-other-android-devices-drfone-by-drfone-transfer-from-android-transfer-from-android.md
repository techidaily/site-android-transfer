## Part 2: Transfer SMS from OnePlus Open to iPhone using Move to iOS app

Transferring text messages from OnePlus Open to iPhone using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer is the best and the fastest way. But it requires a computer and physically connecting the OnePlus Open devices via USB cables. What if the person doesn’t have a computer? They won’t be able to transfer any data from their old Android to a new iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max). If you want to find another way to transfer messages and other stuff from OnePlus Open to iPhone, then Move to the iOS app can help in this task.

Move to iOS is an Android app developed to make it easier to transfer data from OnePlus Open to iOS devices. It is available for free at Google Play Store and is of the minuscule size of approximately 2.2 MB. One doesn’t need to wait extreme time to install the app. With Move to iOS, you will be able to set up the iOS device easily without needing to connect it with a USB cable. But there are some prerequisites that you have to fulfill before you can transfer data from OnePlus Open to iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) or an earlier model-

- • The iPhone must have iOS 9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17
- • iPhone 5 or later is required
- • Android 4.0 and above
- • The iPhone hasn’t been set up yet or the data has been erased
- • Data doesn’t exceed the storage on iPhone
- • Steady Wi-Fi network is available

### How to transfer text messages from Android and iPhone using Move to iOS?

Want to learn how to transfer messages from android to iPhone without USB cables and computers? With the below steps, you can easily transfer messages and other data from OnePlus Open to iPhone like iPhone 14/14 Pro (Max) using Move to iOS -

Step 1: Click on the “Move Data from Android” button on the “Apps and Data” screen during the iPhone setup process. If you have already set up the OnePlus Open device, then you need to erase the data from Settings > General > Reset and then go to Apps and Data screen.

![transfer messages from android to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/move-data-from-android.JPG "Apps and data screen")

Step 2: On the iPhone, click “Continue” on the Move from Android screen. It will generate the 6-digit or 10-digit code.

Step 3: Now on the Android device, download and install the Move to iOS app and open it.

Step 4: Tap on “Continue” and then “Agree” on the terms and conditions screen and then “Next” on the “Find Your Code” screen.

Step 5: Enter the code generated on the iPhone in the “Enter Code” screen.

![enter code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/enter-code.JPG "enter the code to verify")

![process of transferring sms from android to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/02/move-to-ios.JPG "transfer to be complete in a while")

Step 7: After transferring is complete, finish the iPhone device setup process.

The disadvantage that this method has is that you can’t transfer messages from OnePlus Open to iPhone on an already set up iPhone. It only works on a new device or has to erase the data on the target device. Moreover, as it only works with all versions of iOS, the older devices can’t transfer messages through this method. They can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) for the task.
