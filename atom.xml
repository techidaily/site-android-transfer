But generally speaking, we can’t deny that any process that involves the migration of data is sensitive in nature. That’s why it’s important to prepare both devices before officially initiating the data transfer process. Here are some reminders you need to keep in mind before you export contacts from Realme C55 to iPhone.</p><ul><li>Make sure your iPhone is fully charged and carrying enough internal storage.</li><li>Incoming phone calls might interrupt the data transfer process in some ways. Hence, it’s best to turn the Airplane mode on both devices while the contacts are being migrated.</li><li>Don’t use both devices once the data transfer has started.</li><li>Lastly, create a backup file for your contact list. You never know what’s going to happen with the transfer. It’s best to be prepared to avoid data loss.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme 12 Pro 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Realme 12 Pro 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme 12 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Realme 12 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Realme 12 Pro 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme 12 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3.

Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme 12 Pro 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.</p><p>Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device. Most users are at a loss about how to transfer their photos from one android device to another. There are several ways to do that successfully without the risk of losing your priced photos.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme C67 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Realme C67 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme C67 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Realme C67 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Realme C67 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme C67 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme C51 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Realme C51, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme C51 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Realme C51 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Realme C51 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme C51 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3.

A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound.

This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme C33 2023 devices, most tines on the battery pack.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme C67 4G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Realme C67 4G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme C67 4G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below.

Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Realme C67 4G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2.

That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Realme 12 Pro 5G to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.</p><h3 id="Device-Storage"><a href="#Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Device Storage"></a>Device Storage</h3><p>Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Operating-Systems"><a href="#Operating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems"></a>Operating Systems</h3><p>Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient.

How to Do Realme C51 to iPhone Data Transfer Using Dropbox&#x2F;Google Drive</h2><p>Another method for <strong>Realme C51 to iPhone transfer</strong> is using Cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Both Dropbox and Google Drive serve as virtual storage spaces accessible from any device with an internet connection. Users can upload and store their files to the cloud, making them available for download on other devices.</p><p>Either Google Drive or Dropbox follows similar steps for data transfer. The difference between them is in the amount of free storage each service provides. Notably, Google Drive provides 15GB of free storage, while Dropbox offers 2GB.</p><p>Follow these steps on how to do a Realme C51 to iPhone transfer via cloud storage services.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install and set up Dropbox&#x2F;Google Drive:</li></ul><p>Begin by installing the Dropbox or Google Drive app on both your Realme C51 and iPhone. Create accounts if you don’t have them already.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Upload the files from Realme C51</li></ul><p>Open the cloud storage app on your Realme C51 device and upload the data you want to transfer. This can include photos, videos, documents, and more. Then, wait for the upload to complete. Make sure that all files are successfully uploaded before proceeding.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Sign in to the cloud storage on your iPhone</li></ul><p>On your iPhone, open Dropbox or Google Drive and sign in with the same account. Find the transferred files in the cloud storage.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Download to iPhone:</li></ul><p>Select the files you want to transfer and download them to your iPhone. Once the download is complete, organize the transferred files on your iPhone as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/transfer-data-from-motorola-to-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="Realme C51 to iPhone transfer via cloud services."                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Transitioning from a Realme C51 device to an iPhone, or vice versa, may present challenges due to the difference in operating systems. However, with the right tools and methods, the <strong>iPhone to Realme C51 data transfer</strong> can be done seamlessly and efficiently.</p><p>Even though Realme C51 Migrate is no longer in the game, apps like ShareIt and Move to iOS can be alternatives for a direct transfer. If things get a bit trickier when transferring from iPhone to Realme C51 due to Apple’s privacy measures, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone’s Phone Transfer is there to simplify it all.</p><p>And for those who prefer the cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive also offer a solution. So, no matter your preference, there’s a solution to ensure your data transfer moves smoothly.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme 11 Pro devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Realme 11 Pro, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Realme 11 Pro to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Realme 11 Pro, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Realme 11 Pro from where the photos are been sent.

Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Realme 11 Pro to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Realme 11 Pro devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Realme 11 Pro devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Realme 11 Pro devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Realme 11 Pro devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Realme-11-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Realme-11-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Realme-11-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Realme-11-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Realme 11 Pro to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Realme 11 Pro to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-3-Software-to-Transfer-Files-to-from-Your-Realme-11-Pro-via-a-USB-Cable"><a href="#Best-3-Software-to-Transfer-Files-to-from-Your-Realme-11-Pro-via-a-USB-Cable" class="headerlink" title="Best 3 Software to Transfer Files to&#x2F;from Your Realme 11 Pro via a USB Cable"></a>Best 3 Software to Transfer Files to&#x2F;from Your Realme 11 Pro via a USB Cable</h2><p>If you are worried about deleting important information from your Realme 11 Pro, you may wish to simply transfer it up to your computer to keep it.

However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.</p><p>We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Realme 11 Pro with ease.

If your device is under warranty, your best option to get it fixed is taking it to the nearest Apple Store. Otherwise, we’ll look at quick fixes you can use to repair it yourself.</p><p> Before we start, we should clarify that these fixes work with every model of iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that has a Home button. Whether you have an iPhone 8 or an iPhone SE, if the Home button isn’t working you can use the tips below to fix it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Add-an-AssistiveTouch-Home-Button-to-the-Screen"><a href="#1-Add-an-AssistiveTouch-Home-Button-to-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1.

One of these is a perfect workaround to let you keep using your iPhone when the Home button isn’t working. It’s called AssistiveTouch, and Apple designed it for people who have difficulty using physical buttons.</p><p> You can turn on AssistiveTouch from the Settings to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/create-virtual-iphone-home-button-with-assistivetouch/" >add a software-based Home button to your iPhone screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It doesn’t fix your Home button, but it does let you keep using your iPhone without a working Home button.</p><p> Here’s how to add a Home button to your iPhone screen with AssistiveTouch:</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Touch &gt; AssistiveTouch</strong> . On older versions of iOS, you need to go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; AssistiveTouch</strong> instead. If you can’t exit your current app to access Settings,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restart your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to go to the Home screen.</li><li>Turn on the toggle for<strong>AssistiveTouch</strong> . You should see a semi-transparent button appear on your screen. Tap it to reveal a popup menu, then tap<strong>Home</strong> to simulate pressing the Home button.</li><li>Drag and drop the AssistiveTouch button to move it around your iPhone screen so it doesn’t get in the way. You can also use Siri to turn it off and on when you don’t need it.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iPhone-General-Settings.jpg"                      alt="iPhone General Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iPhone-Accessibility-Settings.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Accessibility Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iPhone-Touch-Settings.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Touch Settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> It’s worth taking a moment to customize the AssistiveTouch options from the Settings to make it as useful as possible. If you only use it as a Home button, you can even make that the only option, so you don’t need to open a popup menu anymore.</p><h2 id="2-“Recalibrate”-the-Home-Button"><a href="#2-“Recalibrate”-the-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="2. “Recalibrate” the Home Button"></a>2. “Recalibrate” the Home Button</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Slide-to-power-off-prompt-on-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Slide to power off prompt on iPhone"                ></p><p> We’ve used “recalibrate” in quotes here because this is not an official term. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be a definitive source for this trick, but it’s proven to be effective at fixing iPhone Home buttons regardless of why they aren’t working.</p><p> Again, you can use this trick to fix the Home button on any applicable device. The worst that could happen is that your Home button still doesn’t work after you try it.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><ol><li>Launch any app that came pre-installed on your device. For example, you might open<strong>Notes</strong> ,<strong>Calendar</strong> ,<strong>Reminders</strong> , or<strong>Photos</strong> .</li><li>Now press and hold the<strong>Top</strong> or<strong>Side</strong> button on your iPhone until the<strong>Slide to power off</strong> prompt appears. If nothing appears, try holding either<strong>Volume</strong> button at the same time.</li><li>Don’t power off your iPhone. Instead, press and hold the<strong>Home</strong> button for around 10 seconds until the prompt disappears and the app quits.</li></ol><p> That’s it. This fix should work for physical Home buttons that aren’t working on the iPhone 6S and earlier, as well as the touch-based Home buttons on the iPhone 7 up to the iPhone SE.</p><p> If this didn’t fix your Home button, try repeating the process several times. Some users have reported that their Home button started working after three or four attempts.</p><h2 id="3-Restore-the-Firmware-on-Your-iPhone"><a href="#3-Restore-the-Firmware-on-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3.

A lot of the time when the Home button isn’t working, it comes down to a fault in the software or firmware on your iPhone. You can fix these issues for free by restoring the device using DFU mode.</p><p> When you do this, it erases all the data from your iPhone. So you should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-backup-iphone-ipad/" >make sure you’ve got a recent iPhone backup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first.</p><p> You also need to set aside at least an hour. Restoring your device with DFU mode rewrites every bit of the software and firmware. Sometimes, this takes a while.</p><p> Follow the instructions in our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-dfu-mode-iphone-and-how-to-use-it/" >restoring your iPhone using DFU mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If that doesn’t work, you know your Home button definitely has a hardware problem.

That filth might clog the mechanism, which could explain why the Home button stopped working. Unfortunately, this tip can’t help if the Home button isn’t working on an iPhone 7, an iPhone SE, or later because those devices don’t feature a mechanical button.</p><p>Here’s the proper way to clean the Home button on your iPhone:</p><ol><li>Start off by wiping the Home button using a clean, dry microfiber cloth.</li><li>If that doesn’t work, lightly dampen the cloth with 98 to 99 percent isopropyl alcohol. This evaporates in the air, so it shouldn’t cause damage to your iPhone components.</li><li>Rub the alcohol over the Home button while repeatedly clicking it. As you click the Home button, the alcohol should work its way inside to loosen any dirt.</li></ol><h2 id="5-Use-Your-Charger-to-Press-Against-the-Home-Button"><a href="#5-Use-Your-Charger-to-Press-Against-the-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="5.

Some people have fixed their Home button by applying a small amount of pressure in this area, presumably because doing so reconnected the cable.</p><p> Of course, you need to be incredibly careful when trying this. You don’t want to break anything inside your iPhone. You also need to be careful you don’t snap off the Lightning or 30-pin connector inside the charging port, which can be almost impossible to remove.</p><p>Follow these simple steps to try it:</p><ol><li>Insert the charging cable that came with your iPhone.</li><li>Gently press on the back of the connector, near the bottom of your iPhone, as though you’re pushing it towards the Home button.</li><li>Keep that pressure while you click the Home button a couple of times.</li></ol><p> You will hopefully find that this fixes the Home button on your iPhone for a few weeks or more. However, you’ll probably need to get the Home button on your iPhone replaced eventually. With an iPhone 7 or later, you can’t replace the Home button, so you may need a replacement device instead.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713565&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Mac： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Find-Out-How-to-Replace-the-Home-Button-Yourself"><a href="#Find-Out-How-to-Replace-the-Home-Button-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Find Out How to Replace the Home Button Yourself"></a>Find Out How to Replace the Home Button Yourself</h2><p> If your iPhone is less than a year old, it might still be covered by Apple’s one-year warranty. That means you can make an appointment at the Genius Bar in your nearest Apple Store to have Apple repair your Home button for free.</p><p> Unfortunately, most iPhones with a physical Home button are more than a year old. But you can still pay for a repair from Apple or a third-party service provider.</p><p> That said, it’s usually cheaper to repair it yourself. There are lots of sites that show you how to repair your gadgets, including how to fix a Home button that isn’t working. Some of them even sell all the parts and tools you need for a particular repair.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme 11 Pro+ devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.</p><ol><li><p>To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official <a class="link"   href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your Mac.
