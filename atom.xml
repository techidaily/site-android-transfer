How to Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth"></a>Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth</h2><p>The Presence of Bluetooth technology in phones is as old as android itself.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro as well.</p><p>Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg"                      alt="USB android file transfer"                ></p><p>As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.</p><p>We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-migrate-android-data-from-poco-x5-to-new-android-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Migrate Android Data From Poco X5 to New Android Phone?

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.</p><p>Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device. Most users are at a loss about how to transfer their photos from one android device to another. There are several ways to do that successfully without the risk of losing your priced photos.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.</p><p>Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device. Most users are at a loss about how to transfer their photos from one android device to another. There are several ways to do that successfully without the risk of losing your priced photos.

How to Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nokia XR21 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nokia XR21, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Nokia XR21 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Nokia XR21, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Nokia XR21 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth"></a>Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth</h2><p>The Presence of Bluetooth technology in phones is as old as android itself. The use of this technology offers another method that you can employ in transferring your photos from your Nokia XR21 to your new android device. It is a short and simple method that is known to most android users.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to guide you through the process of successfully transferring your photos from your Nokia XR21 to your new android device. This process involves navigating to the Bluetooth option on your device, connecting to your new device and initiating transfer. The steps are outlined below</p><p>1.

Click “Accept “to establish connection.</p><p>3. After both devices have successfully been paired to each other, go to the folder containing the Photos your want to send to your new Android device. Select the photo or if they are more than one, long press on a photo. This will create a thumbnail. Select the photos you want to transfer and choose the share button normally depicted by this icon</p><p>4. A list of option will appear. Choose Bluetooth. This will take you back to The Bluetooth application. Click on your new android device that you have previously paired with. A Message will appear on your new device asking for permission to receive the photos from your Nokia XR21. Click “Accept”. This will initiate the transfer process. A progress bar at the top of your screen will show you the Progress of each transfer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-bluetooth-01.jpg"                      alt="How to Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by Bluetooth"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Old-to-New-Android-Phones-via-Device-Specific-App"><a href="#Part-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Old-to-New-Android-Phones-via-Device-Specific-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nokia XR21 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><ul><li>On your Nokia XR21, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><ul><li>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><ul><li>Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon.

Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent.

So, if you do not want to lose any data while transfer or worry about the security, use the Dr.Fone toolkit for the best result.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-oppo-reno-9a-to-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos From Oppo Reno 9A to Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-transfer-music-from-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-4g-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Transfer Music from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-itel-p55t-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data After Switching From Itel P55T to Latest Samsung | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-oppo-reno-11-5g-to-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos From Oppo Reno 11 5G to Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-migrate-android-data-from-tecno-pop-7-pro-to-new-android-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Migrate Android Data From Tecno Pop 7 Pro to New Android Phone?

How to Transfer Photos from Nokia G42 5G to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G42 5G to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nokia G42 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nokia G42 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G42 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nokia G42 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Nokia G42 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G42 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Nokia G42 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G42 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Nokia G42 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The importance of checking your Internet connection before proceeding to more extreme measures for all issues cannot be ignored. The issues that may be disturbing you might be due to an issue with your device’s connection to the Internet</p><ol><li>Switch Off and Switch On your Data Connection.</li><li>Go to Settings, then go to “Data Usage” and ensure that Restricting Background Data is disabled on your device.</li></ol><p>Clear the App Cache for Google Contacts.</p><ol><li>Go to Settings</li><li>Then tap on “Apps” or “Apps Manager,” depending on your device and Android version.</li><li>Go to all Apps and find Contact Sync.</li><li>Select Clear Cache and also Clear Data.</li><li>This should knock the Contacts sync back to normal and ensure that your sync goes on without a hitch from there on out.</li></ol><p>Remove your Google Account and set up again. The issue you are facing might be due to a malfunctioning Google Account setup. To fix this:</p><ol><li>Go to Settings.</li><li>Go to Accounts, then proceed to your Google Account.</li><li>Select the Remove Account option</li><li>Then proceed to set up your email account again.</li></ol><p>As a last-ditch fix, some users have reported that an account merging for the contacts fixed the problems of the contacts not syncing. To do this, do the following steps:</p><ol><li>Go to Contacts</li><li>Tap on the menu, then tap on “Contacts to Display” option</li><li>Select “Only Device”. Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Nokia G42 5G device to display.</li><li>Tap on “Menu” and then on “Merge Accounts”</li><li>Select Google Merge. This will merge all your Contacts with Google.</li><li>Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting “Contacts to Display”, then “All Contacts”</li><li>This should make all the contacts on your device to appear, and your sync problem should also be solved.</li></ol><p>These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account. It is also worthy of note that if you want new contacts to be saved automatically to your Google account, you have to select the Google Account option when prompted on where to save the new contact, or else, the contact will not be automatically synced to your Gmail account, and you will have to create an export to add it to your Google Contacts.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that it might take a longer period of time for the contacts to synchronize to Google on a slower network connection, in deviance to a fast network connection, so you might need to exercise some patience if you’re on a slower Internet connection.</p><p>It can sometimes be bewildering and baffling when people probably lose their phones, and then they complain of loss of contacts. However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.</p><p>Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device. Most users are at a loss about how to transfer their photos from one android device to another. There are several ways to do that successfully without the risk of losing your priced photos.

How to Transfer Photos from Nokia G310 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Nokia G310 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nokia G310 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nokia G310, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Nokia G310 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Nokia G310, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Nokia G310 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth"></a>Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth</h2><p>The Presence of Bluetooth technology in phones is as old as android itself. The use of this technology offers another method that you can employ in transferring your photos from your Nokia G310 to your new android device. It is a short and simple method that is known to most android users.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to guide you through the process of successfully transferring your photos from your Nokia G310 to your new android device. This process involves navigating to the Bluetooth option on your device, connecting to your new device and initiating transfer. The steps are outlined below</p><p>1. Locate the Bluetooth on both devices. Go to your Settings and click on the “Connected device “Option. Under that option, you will find Bluetooth, click on it and toggle it on. Do the same for the receiving device.</p><p>2. Your device will start searching for nearby visible devices to pair with. Make Sure your new android device is visible to other devices. When your android device appears on the list of available devices on your old Android, select it to pair.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-bluetooth-02.jpg"                      alt="How to Transfer Photos from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices by Bluetooth-Pair Devices"                ></p><p>A message will pop up on your new android device, requesting permission to pair with your Nokia G310.

There are advantages to transferring contacts using Bluetooth, such as no need for using the internet, going through any other hoops, or opening special apps! Everything you need to share contacts from one Android phone to another is built right into your phone! Now, to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, you must first pair the two devices together so as to allow for seamless contacts transfer.</p><h3 id="I-I-Pairing-Two-Android-Devices-Together"><a href="#I-I-Pairing-Two-Android-Devices-Together" class="headerlink" title="I.I: Pairing Two Android Devices Together"></a>I.I: Pairing Two Android Devices Together</h3><p>Here’s how to pair your old and new phone together via Bluetooth:</p><p>Step 1: On your old and new devices, go to Settings, then Bluetooth</p><p>Step 2: Make sure Bluetooth is “On” on both of them</p><p>Step 3: If everything is done correctly, both devices will show themselves to each other</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-1.jpg"                      alt="enable bluetooth"                ></p><p>Step 4: Tap the other device on either of them.

For your device, make sure that the PIN is the same on both devices to ensure the security of the connection. This PIN is generated afresh and is unique, so the PIN in the image is not the PIN you will see on your devices. Tap Pair on your old device to pair the two devices together using Bluetooth.</p><p>Step 6: After pairing is complete, both devices will show under paired devices on each other:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-3.jpg"                      alt="old device showing paired android"                ></p><p>And that’s how simple it is to pair devices to each other using Bluetooth!</p><h3 id="I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth"><a href="#I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth"></a>I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth</h3><p>Here is how to transfer contacts from one Android to another, easily, using Bluetooth:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Phone on your old phone and select the Contacts tab</p><p>Step 2: Tap the vertical ellipses and select Import&#x2F; Export.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-4.jpg"                      alt="export contacts from old android to new"                ></p><p>This particular option can vary by your phone model and Android flavor, this is on Android 7 running on Motorola G4 Play.

Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Nokia G310 to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Nokia G310 devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Nokia G310 devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Nokia G310 devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Nokia G310 devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Nokia-G310-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Nokia-G310-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Nokia-G310-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Nokia-G310-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Nokia G310 to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Nokia G310 to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Content-from-android-to-iPhone-Directly"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Content-from-android-to-iPhone-Directly" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly"></a>How to Transfer Content from android to iPhone Directly</h2><p>Since Nokia G310 is embracing Android as its operating system, transitioning from an iPhone to a Nokia G310, or vice versa, can pose challenges due to the differing operating systems.

To use it, you’ll need to download the ShareIt app on both your Nokia G310 and iPhone.</p><p>If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Nokia G310 and iPhone devices</li></ul><p>Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it’s necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the files to transfer</li></ul><p>On your Nokia G310 device, click the “Send” button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Look for the Nokia G310 device to transfer</li></ul><p>After selecting the files, press “Send” and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Nokia G310 device will initiate a search for nearby devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Transfer the files to the iPhone.</li></ul><p>On your iPhone, open the ShareIt app and click “Receive.” This action opens all the necessary ports to receive shared files.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nokia G22 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nokia G22 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Nokia G22 to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras.

How to Transfer Photos from Nokia G22 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Nokia G22 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G22 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nokia G22 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nokia G22, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia G22 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nokia G22 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nokia C32 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nokia C32, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Nokia C32 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Nokia C32, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Nokia C32 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-8.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-Go to “Connection”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.</p><p>Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-9.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-pair both devices"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The final step is to head to the File Manager app on your phone or go to your Music Player, select the music file you wish to transfer, and then click on your device’s Share button or logo.</p><p>Here, scroll until you see the “Bluetooth” option. You will be immediately prompted to select the Nokia C32 device to share with, click the earlier paired device name, and then click on “Accept” on the other device.</p><p>This is how you can transfer music files from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-10.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-use Bluetooth"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-transfer-music-from-Nokia-C32-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-NFC"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-transfer-music-from-Nokia-C32-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-NFC" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to transfer music from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices using NFC?"></a>Part 4. How to transfer music from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices using NFC?</h2><p>NFC or Near Field Communication is another wireless means to transfer music from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices. Although, unlike Bluetooth, this method requires contact between the two devices making the transfer.</p><p><strong>Below are the steps on how to transfer music from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices using NFC.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First, enable NFC connection on both the Nokia C32 devices between which you want to transfer the music files. To switch on NFC on Android, go to Phone’s “Settings” and click on “More Settings” under “Wireless and Network” options. Now click on the NFC button to ensure that it is switched On. Do the same on the other Android device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-11.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-click on “More Settings”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Before you begin to transfer, you need to touch the back of both devices (whose NFC has already been turned on), you will notice that both devices vibrate upon a successful connection. This means you can now start transferring your music files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-12.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-start transferring your music files"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> After connecting both the Nokia C32 devices, you will be provided with media options of files that can be transferred. In this case, select the Music files and then click on “Transfer” to send the music files via NFC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-send the music files via NFC"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-transfer-music-from-Nokia-C32-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-Google-Play-Music"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-transfer-music-from-Nokia-C32-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-Google-Play-Music" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nokia C32 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nokia C32, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Nokia C32 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Nokia C32, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nokia C32 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Nokia C32 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nokia C32 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nokia C32 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Nokia C32 to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.
