It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the OnePlus 12R devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your OnePlus 12R, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your OnePlus 12R to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your OnePlus 12R, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your OnePlus 12R from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

If you are an android user and have decided to shift to the iPhone, you will need the Move to iOS tool. The app is developed to help transfer data from an android device to iOS devices. Google play store has the app, and it’s free.</p><p>To use the app, install it on your android device first. The transfer process requires following several simple steps to move to iOS. The app seems easy to use the tool, but newbies must learn about the Move to iOS guidelines to complete the process. With this tool, you will transfer various android data such as camera photos, contacts, message history, mail accounts, calendars, and videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/phone-transfer/move-to-ios-2.jpg"                      alt="move to ios"                ></p><p>Move to iOS app works on android version 4.0 or higher. You can transfer data to any iPhone in a relatively straightforward process. Also, beware that the Move to iOS will work only when setting up a new iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Besides knowing what the content that Moves to iOS tool can transfer, you might be wondering how long the process can take. Depending on the content you want to transfer, the process generally takes around 10 – 30 minutes. However, other factors can determine the time the app will take to move content to iOS. They include the speed of the network, patency of the transmission process, and Wi-Fi stability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/phone-transfer/move-to-ios-5.jpg"                      alt="android move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Move-to-iOS-not-working-problem-lists"><a href="#Part-1-Move-to-iOS-not-working-problem-lists" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists"></a>Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists</h2><p>Users can learn to use the Move to iOS app quickly. However, they will occasionally experience problems while using this tool. If the app runs into errors, you will encounter some problems.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS no code.</strong></li></ul><p>These steps will help you get the Move to iOS code;</p><p>When setting up your iPhone, tap on the move data from the android option. Then, launch the Move to ios app on your android device and tap continue. You will see the find you code screen; tap on the .next’ button to continue.</p><p>Tap on the continue button on your iOS device and wait for a ten-digit code to appear.</p><p>Once you receive the code on your iPhone, enter it on the android device and wait for the Samsung Galaxy M54 5G devices to connect. Select all the content you want to move and click Next.</p><p>Once the loading bar on the iOS device is done, tap on the ‘Done’ button on your android device. Proceed to set up your iOS device using the onscreen steps.</p><p>If you are not receiving any code on your iOS device, you can fix it by ensuring the Wi-Fi is always on throughout the process. You can also reboot your devices if the error is temporary.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS could not communicate correctly with the Samsung Galaxy M54 5G devices.</strong></li></ul><p>To avoid this Move to iOS error, ensure both devices run on updated operating systems, i.e., android 4.0 or later and iOS 9 or later. The phones must have enough power, and lastly, ensure that you turn off background apps to avoid notifications during the transfer process.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS stuck on preparing&#x2F;transferring.</strong></li></ul><p>You are transferring your android data to iOS, but the process is stuck on the transferring page. The problem is related to Wi-Fi connections. Should the Wi-Fi disconnect for a few seconds, the transfer process stops. Other distractions on android such as calls, switching to sleep mode, or other background operations might also cause the Move to iOS error.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS takes forever&#x2F;slow.</strong></li></ul><p>The length of time taken to transfer data from android to iOS depends on the size of the data and Wi-Fi connection. To speed up the transfer, check your Wi-Fi connection, delete unnecessary data from the android device, or restart the transfer if it takes too long.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS Wi-Fi disconnect.</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi drops will obviously interfere with the transfer process. To avoid this error, you can reset your router and the network and turn off smart switching and airplane mode.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS interrupted</strong></li></ul><p>If the Move to iOS process is interrupted, you can fix it by restarting the phone, check your network connections on both devices, turn off the smart network swath on android and turn on the airplane mode.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS, not connecting devices.</strong></li></ul><p>The circumstances can be frustrating as the transfer process will not be completed successfully.

Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone’s private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power"><a href="#Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Plug both devices to power"></a>Tip 4: Plug both devices to power</h3><p>You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Samsung Galaxy M54 5G devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode"><a href="#Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode"></a>Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode</h3><p>When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.</p><p>The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement"><a href="#Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Check the storage requirement"></a>Tip 6: Check the storage requirement</h3><p>Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don’t need to transfer from your android device before getting started.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer"><a href="#Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer"></a>Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer</h3><p>Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices"><a href="#Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices"></a>Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices</h3><p>You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store.

The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode. Therefore you should ensure the feature is closed from the settings of your android device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Move-to-iOS-not-working-solved-without-a-PC"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Move-to-iOS-not-working-solved-without-a-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: [Alternative] Move to iOS not working solved without a PC"></a>Part 3: [Alternative] Move to iOS not working solved without a PC</h2><p>An alternative solution to Move to iOS not working problem is to use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-transfer.html" >Dr. Fone – Phone Manager (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Honor 100 to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Honor 100 to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Honor 100. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Honor 100 to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. At this point, select the option that reads “Move Data from Android.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Honor 100. Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Honor 100, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Honor 100 to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the Honor 100 devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process, and you’re done.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="move data from android with move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Honor-100-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer"><a href="#How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Honor-100-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How To Move Text Messages From Honor 100 to iPhone Quickly with Computer"></a>How To Move Text Messages From Honor 100 to iPhone Quickly with Computer</h2><p>If you’re looking for a swift and reliable way to move text messages from Honor 100 to iPhone, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone can be the perfect go-to solution.</p><p>Packed with a user-friendly interface, this software streamlines the process, ensuring a quick and efficient transfer of your messages through its Phone Transfer feature.

This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Honor 100, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Poco X5 Pro to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Poco X5 Pro devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Poco X5 Pro devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Poco X5 Pro devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Poco X5 Pro devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Poco-X5-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Poco-X5-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Poco X5 Pro to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Poco X5 Pro to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Poco-X5-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Poco-X5-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Poco X5 Pro to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Poco X5 Pro to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Poco X5 Pro to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Music-from-Poco-X5-Pro-to-iPod"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Music-from-Poco-X5-Pro-to-iPod" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Music from Poco X5 Pro to iPod"></a>How to Transfer Music from Poco X5 Pro to iPod</h2><p>If you’re among the fortunate few still holding onto a functioning iPod, consider yourself lucky, as Apple officially bid farewell to the iPod product line in 2022.

Despite the fact that the iPod is an Apple product, transferring its music to an Android device is indeed possible. Apple’s ecosystem may be renowned for its exclusivity, but with the right methods, you can seamlessly bridge the gap between your iPod and an Android device.</p><p>One of the most straightforward ways to transfer music from your iPod to an Android device is by using Bluetooth. It’s worth noting that Bluetooth transfer capability is present in all iPod Touch models but not in older iPod models. Bluetooth support for iPod Touch was introduced with the 2nd Generation and iOS 3.0, while iPod Nano gained support from the 7th Generation onward.</p><p>Alternatively, other methods involve employing a dedicated app and third-party software as an intermediary. Rest assured; the upcoming sections will comprehensively cover these approaches, providing you with the necessary guidance for a smooth music transfer process.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Transfer-Music-from-iPod-to-Android-via-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-1-Transfer-Music-from-iPod-to-Android-via-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

This wireless approach simplifies the process, allowing for seamless data exchange between the two devices.</p><p>But first, you still need to check Bluetooth compatibility. Ensure that both your iPod and Android devices can do Bluetooth transfer. This method is also applicable when you wonder <strong>how to download music from an iPod to an Android phone</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enable Bluetooth on both Devices.</p><p>On your iPod, navigate to the Settings menu and select Bluetooth. Enable Bluetooth on the Android device by accessing its settings as well. Make sure that you have set both devices to discoverable mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pair the Poco X5 Pro devices.</p><p>Search for available Bluetooth devices on your Poco X5 Pro, and select your iPod from the list. Likewise, confirm the pairing request on your iPod.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Initiate file transfer.</p><p>Once paired, locate the music files on your iPod that you wish to transfer. Use the sharing or send via Bluetooth option (this may vary depending on your iPod model) to send the selected music files to your Poco X5 Pro.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Accept the files on Android.</p><p>Accept the incoming Bluetooth transfer request from the iPod. The music files will then be transferred wirelessly from your iPod to the Android device.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Verify transfer success.</p><p>Confirm the successful transfer by checking the music library on your Poco X5 Pro.
