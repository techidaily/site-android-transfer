It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Xiaomi Redmi A2 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Xiaomi Redmi A2, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi A2 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Xiaomi Redmi A2 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Xiaomi Redmi A2 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi A2 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Xiaomi Redmi A2, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi A2 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Xiaomi Redmi A2 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Here’s a detailed guide on how to leverage iTunes for video transfer:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Connect your Xiaomi Redmi A2 and copy or move the desired videos from your Xiaomi Redmi A2 to your computer.

Click on the iPad icon positioned at the top-left corner of iTunes. Next, navigate to the “Movies” tab located in the left sidebar to continue the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-videos-from-android-to-ipad-16.jpg"                      alt="choose the movies option"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Select the “Sync Movies” option by checking the corresponding box and pick out the specific videos you wish to move to your iPad.

Wireless options like Google Drive and email are convenient. At the same time, wired methods such as using iTunes and the many capabilities of Wondershare Dr.Fone stand out.

You can transfer everything from your old Android device’s internal storage to your new smartphone. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Connect your phones using a USB-C to USB-C cable. Your Samsung Galaxy S23 came with it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-12.jpg"                      alt="connecting phones with a usb cable"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Tap <strong>Connected to Android</strong>on your Galaxy S23 phone and select <strong>MTP Host</strong> (Media Transfer Protocol).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-13.jpg"                      alt="establishing a usb connection"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>Tap <strong>Allow</strong>on your old Android to enable data access.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-14.jpg"                      alt="allowing data access"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Choose the desired file manager on your new phone and browse your old Android’s internal storage.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-15.jpg"                      alt="accessing android data"                ></p><ol start="5"><li>Choose folders or files to transfer, tap the <strong>kebab menu</strong>for more options, and select <strong>Copy to</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-16.jpg"                      alt="choosing data to transfer"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>Pick any location on your Samsung S23 phone (e.g., the <strong>Downloads</strong>folder for quick access) and tap <strong>Copy</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-17.jpg"                      alt="transferring data to samsung s23"                ></p><p>Moving data between phones using a USB cable is faster than Bluetooth but offers the same functionality.

Use an SD Card"></a>7. Use an SD Card</h3><p>We can almost see you fumbling with your Samsung S23, looking for an SD or microSD card slot. Newsflash: there isn’t one. Like its predecessors, S21 and S22, the Galaxy S23 series doesn’t support expandable storage.</p><p>How can you transfer data from an SD card, then? Well, there’s always your computer. You can migrate your SD card data to your desktop or laptop before moving it to your new Galaxy phone.</p><p>It may not be as straightforward as the methods above, but it’s ideal for keeping precious files from your old Android’s SD card. Here’s what to do:</p><ol><li>Select the desired files or folders on your old Android, tap <strong>Move</strong>, and choose your <strong>SD card</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-18.jpg"                      alt="moving files to an sd card"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Connect the Android to your computer with a USB cable.</li><li>Tap <strong>USB for file transfer</strong>in the <strong>Notification panel</strong> and select <strong>Transferring files &#x2F; Android Auto</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-19.jpg"                      alt="choosing a usb for file transfer"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Go to <strong>This PC</strong>in <strong>File Explorer</strong> and open your phone under <strong>Devices and drives</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the folders or files you wish to move, select <strong>Copy</strong>, and paste them to any location on your computer.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-20.jpg"                      alt="transferring files to a pc"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>Once you move the data, safely disconnect your old Android and connect your Samsung S23 to the PC.</li><li>Go to the folder with your newly saved data and copy-paste it to your Samsung S23.</li></ol><p>This method is best for transferring photos, videos, and other files from an SD card you might not use anymore. After all, smartphone manufacturers increasingly ditch SD card slots for sleek, more compact designs.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Switching from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to Samsung S23 is a breeze because you have many data transfer options. Besides Samsung’s Smart Switch, you can use your synced Google Account, Google Drive, Bluetooth, or a USB-C to USB-C cable. You can also migrate data from your old Android SD card to your computer before transferring it to your new phone.</p><p>However, Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer might be your best option. Besides transferring files, it features many tools for seamless phone management, making it a fantastic addition to your digital toolbox.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-teach-you-to-transfer-files-from-honor-v-purse-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways To Teach You To Transfer Files from Honor V Purse to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-transfer-music-from-nokia-c12-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Transfer Music from Nokia C12 to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-vivo-y100-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Vivo Y100 to Samsung Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-music-from-meizu-21-pro-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Music from Meizu 21 Pro to iPod | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-i-transferred-messages-from-realme-11-pro-to-iphone-12xs-max-in-seconds-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How I Transferred Messages from Realme 11 Pro to iPhone 12/XS (Max) in Seconds | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-tecno-spark-go-2023-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Tecno Spark Go (2023) to New Android?

Transferring data from one part of the world to another can be done in the blink of an eye. Transferring data from one phone to another should be that simple right? Well, it is if you are using devices with the same OS. But, what should you do if you want to transfer data from, let’s say, Android to BlackBerry? Don’t worry. It is possible, and we will guide you step by step through the entire process.</p><h2 id="Option-1-Issues-about-transferring-data-from-Xiaomi-Redmi-13C-to-BlackBerry"><a href="#Option-1-Issues-about-transferring-data-from-Xiaomi-Redmi-13C-to-BlackBerry" class="headerlink" title="Option 1: Issues about transferring data from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to BlackBerry"></a>Option 1: Issues about transferring data from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to BlackBerry</h2><p>When transferring data from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to BlackBerry, you can’t use Bluetooth or a third party software that will help you speed up the process. And unfortunately, you will sometimes wish that you can speed up this process. You can try to manually transfer data from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to a computer, and then from a computer to BlackBerry, but this process can take hours. It is boring to transfer the files from one place to another, and the time it takes is a real pain in the neck. And also, it is impossible to transfer apps from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to BlackBerry because of different operating systems. Sometimes, not even all photos, videos and music files will be compatible. But, luckily, the BlackBerry developers have thought of a one way, which is simpler than the manual transfer mentioned above, to transfer your data from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to BlackBerry. It takes less time, but you still need to do some work.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-transfer-data-from-Xiaomi-Redmi-13C-to-Blackberry-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-transfer-data-from-Xiaomi-Redmi-13C-to-Blackberry-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to transfer data from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to Blackberry (Free)"></a>Part 2: How to transfer data from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to Blackberry (Free)</h2><p>The BlackBerry developers have thought of an app that will help you transfer your contacts, calendar videos and photos from and Android device to a BlackBerry.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><ul><li>On your Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><ul><li>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><ul><li>Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon.

NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.</li></ul><p>To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent.

Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Xiaomi-Redmi-12-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Xiaomi-Redmi-12-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Xiaomi-Redmi-12-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Xiaomi-Redmi-12-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-vivo-s17-pro-to-laptop-without-usb-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Vivo S17 Pro to Laptop Without USB | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-apps-from-oneplus-nord-ce-3-5g-to-another-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Apps from OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G to Another | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-3-software-to-transfer-files-tofrom-your-tecno-camon-20-premier-5g-via-a-usb-cable-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Best 3 Software to Transfer Files to/from Your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G via a USB Cable | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to New Android?
