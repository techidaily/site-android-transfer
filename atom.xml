Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your Realme Narzo N55 with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your Realme Narzo N55 as well.</p><p>Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg"                      alt="USB android file transfer"                ></p><p>As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.</p><p>We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Realme Narzo N55 with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-prime-routines-for-documenting-live-sports-events/"><u>[New] In 2024, Prime Routines for Documenting Live Sports Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-securing-skype-conversations-via-obs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Securing Skype Conversations via OBS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-spectrumstreams-2024-worldwide-selection-at-fingertips/"><u>[New] SpectrumStreams 2024 Worldwide Selection at Fingertips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-5-fastest-indie-film-tips-for-at-home-creators/"><u>2024 Approved 5 Fastest Indie Film Tips for At-Home Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-beat-junkies-essentials-online-cost-free-software/"><u>2024 Approved Beat Junkies' Essentials Online, Cost-Free Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-pages.techidaily.com/convert-pdf-to-flipbooks-easily-using-flip-builder-design-and-edit-page-turning-books-instantly/"><u>Convert PDF to Flipbooks Easily Using Flip Builder – Design and Edit Page-Turning Books Instantly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/enshrouded-game-fixed-smooth-performance-now-on-pc/"><u>Enshrouded Game Fixed: Smooth Performance Now on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-hidefake-snapchat-location-on-your-sony-xperia-5-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Sony Xperia 5 V | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-infinix-smart-8-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data After Switching From Infinix Smart 8 to Latest Samsung | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-nokia-g22-to-blackberry-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Nokia G22 to BlackBerry | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-tactical-edition-to-any-ios-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition to Any iOS Devices | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-nokia-xr21-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Nokia XR21 to New Android?

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Samsung Galaxy F04 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Samsung Galaxy F04 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Samsung Galaxy F04 to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105869/7443" target="_top" id="2105869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Lava Blaze 2 5G to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution.

With the Lava Blaze 2 5G devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Lava Blaze 2 5G before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Lava Blaze 2 5G, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857869/11832" target="_top" id="857869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857869/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

All the methods mentioned above are easy to execute and will help you transfer contacts from the phone to Gmail in a snap.</p><p>Lastly, you can also use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html" >Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for smoothly exporting contacts from Lava Blaze 2 5G to Gmail.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-techniques-for-effective-display-saving-on-dell/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unveiling Techniques for Effective Display Saving on Dell</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/rom-novice-to-money-maker-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Novice to Money-Maker on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-virtual-venue-vaults-users/"><u>2024 Approved Virtual Venue Vaults Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-vivo-y100t-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Vivo Y100t to Other Android Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-vivo-y100a-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Vivo Y100A to New Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-tecno-phantom-v-fold-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Tecno Phantom V Fold to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-move-contacts-from-realme-narzo-n53-to-iphone-131415-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Move Contacts From Realme Narzo N53 to iPhone (13/14/15) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-transfer-music-from-honor-90-pro-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Transfer Music from Honor 90 Pro to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-review-and-guide-to-techeligible-frp-bypass-and-more-for-oppo-a79-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Review & Guide to Techeligible FRP Bypass and More For Oppo A79 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-itel-a60-to-blackberry-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data from Itel A60 to BlackBerry | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-photos-from-nokia-c02-to-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Photos From Nokia C02 to Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/integrating-social-media-into-work-culture-effectively/"><u>Integrating Social Media Into Work Culture Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/leading-apps-to-monitor-facebook-twitter-and-instagram-tags/"><u>Leading Apps to Monitor Facebook, Twitter and Instagram Tags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/the-new-era-of-content-creation-and-profitability-for-2024/"><u>The New Era of Content Creation and Profitability for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-best.techidaily.com/uberwindung-von-dvd-sicherheitsmassnahmen-effiziente-strategien-fur-das-kopieren/"><u>Überwindung Von DVD-Sicherheitsmaßnahmen: Effiziente Strategien Für Das Kopieren</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen.

Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process, and you’re done.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="move data from android with move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Realme-12-Pro-5G-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer"><a href="#How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Realme-12-Pro-5G-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How To Move Text Messages From Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone Quickly with Computer"></a>How To Move Text Messages From Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone Quickly with Computer</h2><p>If you’re looking for a swift and reliable way to move text messages from Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone can be the perfect go-to solution.</p><p>Packed with a user-friendly interface, this software streamlines the process, ensuring a quick and efficient transfer of your messages through its Phone Transfer feature.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

This method operates for both new and already set-up iPhones. Follow these instructions to sync your contacts to your Google account and subsequently access them on your iPhone:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access the Google Contacts app on your Vivo Y100i and tap on the “Profile” icon at the top right corner.

To learn how to transfer music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on transfer"                ></p></li><li><p>Connect both Android phones and iPhone to software and let them be detected automatically. From the top-left option, make sure you have selected your Realme GT 3 as a default&#x2F;source device. The interface will provide its snapshot with some shortcuts.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-files-quickly-to-android-1.png"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-select your Realme GT 3 as a source device"                ></p></li><li><p>To manage the music files stored on the Android device, go to the “Music” tab on the interface. Here, you can view all music files, podcasts, audiobooks, songs, etc., listed in different categories.</p></li><li><p>Choose the files and then select the export button on the toolbar. From here, select the connected iPhone as a source.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/android-transfer-export-music-01.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on the export icon"                ></p></li><li><p>Wait a moment and let the application automatically transfer your selected music files from your Realme GT 3 to your iPhone.</p><p> Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Realme GT 3 to iTunes as well. To do this, you need to select the “Transfer Device Media to iTunes” option from its home page. This will launch a pop-up window and let you move your music files from the Android device to iTunes directly.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/mac-android-transfer-to-itunes-01.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-Transfer Device Media to iTunes"                ></p></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In this way, you can selectively transfer music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone in a hassle-free manner.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-transfer-music-from-Realme-GT-3-to-iPhone-using-Android-File-Transfer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-transfer-music-from-Realme-GT-3-to-iPhone-using-Android-File-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to transfer music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone using Android File Transfer?"></a>Part 3: How to transfer music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone using Android File Transfer?</h2><p>If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Realme GT 3 to your system. Though, to transfer music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.</p><ol><li><p>To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official <a class="link"   href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.</p></li><li><p>Now, connect your Realme GT 3 to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).</p></li><li><p>Go to the Music folder, copy your favorite songs, and save them to your Mac. After that, you can transfer music from your Realme GT 3 to your Mac.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iPhone-Go to the Music folder"                ></p></li><li><p>Great! You are halfway there. Launch iTunes on your Mac and add the newly transferred music to it. You can drag and drop it from the Finder to iTunes. Alternatively, you can also go to its options and click on “Add files to Library”. In this way, you can manually add new music to your iTunes library.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-Add files to Library"                ></p></li><li><p>Once you have transferred the newly added music to iTunes, connect your target iPhone to the system, and let iTunes detect it automatically.</p></li><li><p>Select your iPhone from the Realme GT 3 devices and go to its “Music” tab. From here, you can enable the “Sync Music” options. Select the playlists and songs you wish to move and click on the “Apply” button to initiate the process.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-Select the playlists and songs"                ></p></li></ol><p>Needless to say, the process is a bit complicated. Furthermore, you might face some compatibility issues between your devices and iTunes as well. To avoid all this unwanted hassle, you can simply take Dr.Fone applications’ assistance and transfer music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone effortlessly. In this way, you can learn how to send music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone through iTunes and Android File Transfer.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-transfer-streaming-music-from-Realme-GT-3-to-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-transfer-streaming-music-from-Realme-GT-3-to-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone?</h2><p>These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them. The good thing about these streaming services is that you can access your music from multiple devices. For instance, let’s consider the example of Spotify.</p><p>Once you have created a playlist on your Spotify account, you can access it from any other device. You can even access your music by visiting its website because it will be stored on Spotify’s server and not your device itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-transfer streaming music"                ></p><p>If you are moving from an Android to an iPhone, you can follow these steps to ensure your Spotify music won’t be lost.</p><ul><li>Launch Spotify on your Realme GT 3 and go to the Playlist tab. From here, you can create a playlist. Later, you can add your favorite songs to this playlist as well. You can even create multiple playlists on the app.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-create a playlist"                ></p><ul><li>Afterward, unlock your iPhone and go to the App store. Look for the music streaming app and download it on your phone.</li><li>Once you log in to your Spotify account using your credentials, you can access “My Music” and access all your saved playlists.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer music from android to iphone-access all your saved playlists"                ></p><p>The same drill can be followed for all the other streaming services as well. While you can sync your music using these streaming services, the songs you have made available offline will not be listed here. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have saved them in a playlist beforehand.</p><p>When you know how to move music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone, you can easily make this transition. Go ahead and pick a preferred option to transfer music from Realme GT 3 to iPhone. For a one-click transfer of data, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, while to make a selective transfer, you can try <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html" >Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Here’s how to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Google Sync:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings on your old device</p><p>Step 2: Tap Accounts</p><p>Step 3: Tap the account you want to transfer contacts from</p><p>Step 4: Make sure that there is a checkmark next to Contacts, or, in other words, Contacts sync is enabled&#x2F; toggled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-9.jpg"                      alt="enable contacts sync in google account settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972684/19272" target="_top" id="1972684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now, Google will sync your contacts from the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device onto the cloud, and your new device signed into the same Google Account will automatically download the contacts.</p><h3 id="II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps"><a href="#II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps"></a>II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps</h3><p>Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Nubia-Red-Magic-8S-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Nubia-Red-Magic-8S-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Nubia-Red-Magic-8S-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Nubia-Red-Magic-8S-Pro-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-masterful-selection-top-15-accessories-for-gopro-enthusiasts/"><u>[New] Masterful Selection Top 15 Accessories for GoPro Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-media-management-with-best-videographers-on-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Media Management with Best Videographers on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-seamless-and-secure-downloading-instagram-videos-from-your-computermacos/"><u>[Updated] Seamless & Secure Downloading Instagram Videos From Your Computer/MacOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-recovering-messages-files-on-poco-c51-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Complete guide for recovering messages files on Poco C51</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/hering-youtubes-shorts-funding-mechanism/"><u>Deciphering YouTube's Shorts Funding Mechanism</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-infinix-hot-40i-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Infinix Hot 40i to Samsung Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-vivo-y100t-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Text Messages from Vivo Y100t to New Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-ways-to-transfer-music-from-realme-narzo-60-5g-to-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 4 Ways to Transfer Music from Realme Narzo 60 5G to iPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-to-apple-how-to-transfer-photos-from-infinix-note-30-vip-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Android to Apple How To Transfer Photos From Infinix Note 30 VIP to iPad Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-evolving-videography-redefining-social-sharing-with-periscope-alternatives/"><u>In 2024, Evolving Videography Redefining Social Sharing with Periscope Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-migrate-android-data-from-realme-gt-5-to-new-android-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Migrate Android Data From Realme GT 5 to New Android Phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-tecno-pop-8-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Tecno Pop 8 to Other Android Devices Using Bluetooth? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-vivo-y78-5g-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data from Vivo Y78 5G to Other Android Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/transformez-vos-videos-mpeg-en-3gp-pour-mobile-conversion-gratuite-en-ligne-movavi-solutions/"><u>Transformez Vos Vidéos MPEG en 3Gp Pour Mobile : Conversion Gratuite en Ligne - Movavi Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/troubleshoot-and-repair-snipping-tool-malfunctions-for-windows-1011-users/"><u>Troubleshoot and Repair Snipping Tool Malfunctions for Windows 10/11 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/unraveling-fixes-for-the-troublesome-windows-update-failed-code-0x80244022-explained/"><u>Unraveling Fixes for the Troublesome 'Windows Update Failed' - Code 0X80244022 Explained</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone’s private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105860/7443" target="_top" id="2105860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power"><a href="#Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Plug both devices to power"></a>Tip 4: Plug both devices to power</h3><p>You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process.

Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.</p><p>The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement"><a href="#Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Check the storage requirement"></a>Tip 6: Check the storage requirement</h3><p>Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device.

Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Samsung Galaxy A25 5G to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Samsung Galaxy A25 5G to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Samsung Galaxy A25 5G. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Samsung Galaxy A25 5G to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. At this point, select the option that reads “Move Data from Android.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Samsung Galaxy A25 5G. Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Samsung Galaxy A25 5G, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone.

With the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Samsung Galaxy A25 5G before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Samsung Galaxy A25 5G, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.
