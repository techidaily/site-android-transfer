It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Realme C67 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Realme C67 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme C67 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Realme C67 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Realme C67 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Realme C67 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3.

A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process.

There are multiple ways that Android offers to move apps between two smartphones. These include using the Google Play Store and signing in with the same Google account. Also, multiple tools and apps can assist you in this context.</p><p>By contrast, it is not feasible to <strong>transfer apps to a new Android phone</strong> from an iPhone. That’s mainly because of the different operating software in the two devices. The applications downloaded in iOS are not compatible with Android. Additionally, Google Play Store does not support these iOS applications. That’s why directly transferring apps from iPhone to Android is impossible. You must download it again from the Google Play Store on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Apps-From-One-Android-Device-to-Another-in-3-Simplified-Steps"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Apps-From-One-Android-Device-to-Another-in-3-Simplified-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Transfer Apps From One Android Device to Another in 3 Simplified Steps?"></a>Part 2: How To Transfer Apps From One Android Device to Another in 3 Simplified Steps?</h2><p>You can try <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.net/phone-switch.html"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</u></a> tool if you are trying to transfer apps from one Android to another.

Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Oppo A38 to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Oppo A38 devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Oppo A38 devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Oppo A38 devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Oppo A38 devices in all possible ways.

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Oppo A38 to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-explore-10-youtube-creators-accelerating-their-popularity/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Explore 10 YouTube Creators Accelerating Their Popularity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlocking-network-growth-share-igtv-videos-and-fb/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unlocking Network Growth  Share IGTV Videos & FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-elevate-your-digital-footprint-with-effective-fb-page-management-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevate Your Digital Footprint with Effective FB Page Management for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-creative-capture-uncovering-the-top-6-ways-to-document-minecraft-sessions/"><u>[New] In 2024, Creative Capture  Uncovering the Top 6 Ways to Document Minecraft Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-cultivating-patience-with-youtube-disapproval/"><u>[New] In 2024, Cultivating Patience with YouTube Disapproval</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-digitally-chronicled-tweets-of-the-year-so-far/"><u>[New] In 2024, Digitally Chronicled Tweets of the Year So Far</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-recording-your-mac-experience-for-free-for-2024/"><u>[New] Recording Your Mac Experience for FREE for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-harnessing-hobbies-for-hefty-helpings-on-digital-domains/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Harnessing Hobbies for Hefty Helpings on Digital Domains</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-avoiding-lost-frames-during-video-capture-in-obs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Avoiding Lost Frames During Video Capture in OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-productive-online-team-sessions/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Productive Online Team Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-obs-and-fb-live/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Art of OBS and FB Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-streamline-your-snapchat-chat-and-calls-with-3-key-steps/"><u>[Updated] Streamline Your Snapchat Chat and Calls with 3 Key Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-game-changing-growl-techniques-in-free-fire/"><u>2024 Approved  Game-Changing Growl Techniques in Free Fire</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/bitraser-unveiled-a-comprehensive-video-demonstration-of-high-level-data-purging/"><u>BitRaser Unveiled: A Comprehensive Video Demonstration of High-Level Data Purging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-brilliant.techidaily.com/boost-website-analytics-with-advanced-cookiebot-technology/"><u>Boost Website Analytics with Advanced Cookiebot Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/chatgpt-as-your-go-to-linguistic-bridge-tips-and-tricks-for-seamless-translation/"><u>ChatGPT as Your Go-To Linguistic Bridge: Tips & Tricks for Seamless Translation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/fixing-errors-and-enhancing-performance-of-win1110s-sm-bus-controllers/"><u>Fixing Errors & Enhancing Performance of WIN11/10's SM Bus Controllers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/google-play-services-wont-update-12-fixes-are-here-on-oppo-reno-8t-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Google Play Services Wont Update?

If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Vivo S18e devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode"><a href="#Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode"></a>Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode</h3><p>When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.</p><p>The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement"><a href="#Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Check the storage requirement"></a>Tip 6: Check the storage requirement</h3><p>Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from OnePlus Ace 2V to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from OnePlus Ace 2V to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your OnePlus Ace 2V. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from OnePlus Ace 2V to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen.

Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your OnePlus Ace 2V, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your OnePlus Ace 2V to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the OnePlus Ace 2V devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process, and you’re done.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="move data from android with move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-OnePlus-Ace-2V-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer"><a href="#How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-OnePlus-Ace-2V-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How To Move Text Messages From OnePlus Ace 2V to iPhone Quickly with Computer"></a>How To Move Text Messages From OnePlus Ace 2V to iPhone Quickly with Computer</h2><p>If you’re looking for a swift and reliable way to move text messages from OnePlus Ace 2V to iPhone, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone can be the perfect go-to solution.</p><p>Packed with a user-friendly interface, this software streamlines the process, ensuring a quick and efficient transfer of your messages through its Phone Transfer feature.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your OnePlus Ace 2V before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your OnePlus Ace 2V, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your OnePlus Ace 2V’s Settings. Start by opening your Android “Settings” and navigate to the “System,” “System &amp; Updates,” or “About phone” section.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “Backup” or “Backup &amp; Restore”. Within the “System” settings, look for the “Backup” or “Backup &amp; Restore” option. Tap to access the backup settings for your device.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose a Google account. Under the backup settings, you’ll find the option to select the Google account to which you want to back up your data. Make sure that you are signed in with the Google account you want to use for the backup.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Turn on backup. Your phone will show you that turning on backup will include backing up your text messages. Tap “Turn on” to proceed with the backup.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-android-to-ios-1.png"                      alt="source and target phones"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="back-up messages with google drive"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Lava Blaze 2 to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Lava Blaze 2 to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Lava Blaze 2. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Lava Blaze 2 to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. At this point, select the option that reads “Move Data from Android.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Lava Blaze 2. Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Lava Blaze 2, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Lava Blaze 2 to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the Lava Blaze 2 devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process, and you’re done.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="move data from android with move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Lava-Blaze-2-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer"><a href="#How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Lava-Blaze-2-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How To Move Text Messages From Lava Blaze 2 to iPhone Quickly with Computer"></a>How To Move Text Messages From Lava Blaze 2 to iPhone Quickly with Computer</h2><p>If you’re looking for a swift and reliable way to move text messages from Lava Blaze 2 to iPhone, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone can be the perfect go-to solution.</p><p>Packed with a user-friendly interface, this software streamlines the process, ensuring a quick and efficient transfer of your messages through its Phone Transfer feature.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Lava Blaze 2 before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Lava Blaze 2, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Poco C55 to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Poco C55 to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Poco C55. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Poco C55 to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. At this point, select the option that reads “Move Data from Android.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Poco C55. Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Poco C55, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Poco C55 to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the Poco C55 devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process, and you’re done.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="move data from android with move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Poco-C55-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer"><a href="#How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Poco-C55-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How To Move Text Messages From Poco C55 to iPhone Quickly with Computer"></a>How To Move Text Messages From Poco C55 to iPhone Quickly with Computer</h2><p>If you’re looking for a swift and reliable way to move text messages from Poco C55 to iPhone, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone can be the perfect go-to solution.</p><p>Packed with a user-friendly interface, this software streamlines the process, ensuring a quick and efficient transfer of your messages through its Phone Transfer feature.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Poco C55 before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Poco C55, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

The importance of checking your Internet connection before proceeding to more extreme measures for all issues cannot be ignored. The issues that may be disturbing you might be due to an issue with your device’s connection to the Internet</p><ol><li>Switch Off and Switch On your Data Connection.</li><li>Go to Settings, then go to “Data Usage” and ensure that Restricting Background Data is disabled on your device.</li></ol><p>Clear the App Cache for Google Contacts.</p><ol><li>Go to Settings</li><li>Then tap on “Apps” or “Apps Manager,” depending on your device and Android version.</li><li>Go to all Apps and find Contact Sync.</li><li>Select Clear Cache and also Clear Data.</li><li>This should knock the Contacts sync back to normal and ensure that your sync goes on without a hitch from there on out.</li></ol><p>Remove your Google Account and set up again.

To fix this:</p><ol><li>Go to Settings.</li><li>Go to Accounts, then proceed to your Google Account.</li><li>Select the Remove Account option</li><li>Then proceed to set up your email account again.</li></ol><p>As a last-ditch fix, some users have reported that an account merging for the contacts fixed the problems of the contacts not syncing. To do this, do the following steps:</p><ol><li>Go to Contacts</li><li>Tap on the menu, then tap on “Contacts to Display” option</li><li>Select “Only Device”. Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Vivo V27 device to display.</li><li>Tap on “Menu” and then on “Merge Accounts”</li><li>Select Google Merge. This will merge all your Contacts with Google.</li><li>Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting “Contacts to Display”, then “All Contacts”</li><li>This should make all the contacts on your device to appear, and your sync problem should also be solved.</li></ol><p>These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account. It is also worthy of note that if you want new contacts to be saved automatically to your Google account, you have to select the Google Account option when prompted on where to save the new contact, or else, the contact will not be automatically synced to your Gmail account, and you will have to create an export to add it to your Google Contacts.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that it might take a longer period of time for the contacts to synchronize to Google on a slower network connection, in deviance to a fast network connection, so you might need to exercise some patience if you’re on a slower Internet connection.</p><p>It can sometimes be bewildering and baffling when people probably lose their phones, and then they complain of loss of contacts. However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts. All the methods mentioned above are easy to execute and will help you transfer contacts from the phone to Gmail in a snap.</p><p>Lastly, you can also use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html" >Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for smoothly exporting contacts from Vivo V27 to Gmail.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-Phone-Clone-to-Migrate-Your-Vivo-V27-Data"><a href="#How-to-Use-Phone-Clone-to-Migrate-Your-Vivo-V27-Data" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Phone Clone to Migrate Your Vivo V27 Data?"></a>How to Use Phone Clone to Migrate Your Vivo V27 Data?</h2><p>Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</p><h2 id="Best-Tool-to-Migrate-Huawei-Phone-Data"><a href="#Best-Tool-to-Migrate-Huawei-Phone-Data" class="headerlink" title="Best Tool to Migrate Huawei Phone Data"></a>Best Tool to Migrate Huawei Phone Data</h2><ul><li>Transfers any data between devices.</li><li>Supports all phone models like iPhone, Samsung, Huawei, LG, Moto, etc.</li><li>2-3x faster transfer process compared to other transfer tools.</li><li>Data kept absolutely secure during the transfer.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/phone-clone/huawei-phone-clone.html#video-article-bannner" >Watch Video Tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/selena-lee/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/selena-lee.png"                      alt="Selena Lee"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The rapid change in the mobile models has made it difficult for us to keep up with the trend.

Review the terms and conditions and press “Agree” to proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code</p><p>On your iPod, a six to ten-digit code will be displayed. Enter this code when prompted on your Vivo V27.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer</p><p>In the Move to iOS app, choose “Music” to transfer your music files specifically. Then, tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process. Remember to keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed for quicker transfer.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Transfer complete.</p><p>Allow the app to complete the transfer process.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from OnePlus 12 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from OnePlus 12 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your OnePlus 12 to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

How to transfer music from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?"></a>Part 3. How to transfer music from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?</h2><p>Bluetooth transfer is one of the oldest methods that can be used to transfer music from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices, and it is a simple way to make use of it.</p><p><strong>Here are the steps to follow to know how to transfer music from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your OnePlus 12</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> The first method is to swipe from top to down on your OnePlus 12 to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your OnePlus 12, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-8.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-Go to “Connection”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.</p><p>Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-9.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-pair both devices"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The final step is to head to the File Manager app on your phone or go to your Music Player, select the music file you wish to transfer, and then click on your device’s Share button or logo.</p><p>Here, scroll until you see the “Bluetooth” option. You will be immediately prompted to select the OnePlus 12 device to share with, click the earlier paired device name, and then click on “Accept” on the other device.</p><p>This is how you can transfer music files from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-10.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-use Bluetooth"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2069351&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-24_%282%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-transfer-music-from-OnePlus-12-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-NFC"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-transfer-music-from-OnePlus-12-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-NFC" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from OnePlus Ace 2 to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from OnePlus Ace 2 to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your OnePlus Ace 2. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from OnePlus Ace 2 to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen.

Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your OnePlus Ace 2, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your OnePlus Ace 2 to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the OnePlus Ace 2 devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your OnePlus Ace 2 before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your OnePlus Ace 2, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Xiaomi 13T Pro before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Xiaomi 13T Pro, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.
