It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.</p><h3 id="File-Size"><a href="#File-Size" class="headerlink" title="File Size"></a>File Size</h3><p>The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from OnePlus Ace 2 Pro to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.</p><h3 id="Device-Storage"><a href="#Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Device Storage"></a>Device Storage</h3><p>Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.</p><h3 id="Operating-Systems"><a href="#Operating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems"></a>Operating Systems</h3><p>Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from OnePlus Ace 2 Pro to iPhone 15 conveniently.</p><h2 id="5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From OnePlus Ace 2 Pro to iPhone 15"></a>5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From OnePlus Ace 2 Pro to iPhone 15</h2><p>Sharing files between Android and iOS smartphones has become a lot easier today than ever before.

How to Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth"></a>Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth</h2><p>The Presence of Bluetooth technology in phones is as old as android itself. The use of this technology offers another method that you can employ in transferring your photos from your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to your new android device. It is a short and simple method that is known to most android users.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to guide you through the process of successfully transferring your photos from your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to your new android device. This process involves navigating to the Bluetooth option on your device, connecting to your new device and initiating transfer. The steps are outlined below</p><p>1.

Click “Accept “to establish connection.</p><p>3. After both devices have successfully been paired to each other, go to the folder containing the Photos your want to send to your new Android device. Select the photo or if they are more than one, long press on a photo. This will create a thumbnail. Select the photos you want to transfer and choose the share button normally depicted by this icon</p><p>4. A list of option will appear. Choose Bluetooth. This will take you back to The Bluetooth application. Click on your new android device that you have previously paired with.

There are multiple ways that Android offers to move apps between two smartphones. These include using the Google Play Store and signing in with the same Google account. Also, multiple tools and apps can assist you in this context.</p><p>By contrast, it is not feasible to <strong>transfer apps to a new Android phone</strong> from an iPhone.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from OnePlus 11R to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from OnePlus 11R to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your OnePlus 11R to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

How to Transfer Photos from Nubia Z50 Ultra to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Nubia Z50 Ultra to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Z50 Ultra to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Nubia Z50 Ultra devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Nubia Z50 Ultra, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Z50 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Nubia Z50 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Nubia Z50 Ultra to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Z50 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Nubia Z50 Ultra, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Nubia Z50 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Nubia Z50 Ultra from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth"></a>Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth</h2><p>The Presence of Bluetooth technology in phones is as old as android itself. The use of this technology offers another method that you can employ in transferring your photos from your Nubia Z50 Ultra to your new android device. It is a short and simple method that is known to most android users.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to guide you through the process of successfully transferring your photos from your Nubia Z50 Ultra to your new android device. This process involves navigating to the Bluetooth option on your device, connecting to your new device and initiating transfer. The steps are outlined below</p><p>1.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nubia Z50 Ultra to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Nubia Z50 Ultra to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Nubia Z50 Ultra to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the OnePlus 12R devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your OnePlus 12R, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your OnePlus 12R to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your OnePlus 12R, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your OnePlus 12R from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound.

Tap Pair on your old device to pair the two devices together using Bluetooth.</p><p>Step 6: After pairing is complete, both devices will show under paired devices on each other:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-3.jpg"                      alt="old device showing paired android"                ></p><p>And that’s how simple it is to pair devices to each other using Bluetooth!</p><h3 id="I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth"><a href="#I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth"></a>I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth</h3><p>Here is how to transfer contacts from one Android to another, easily, using Bluetooth:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Phone on your old phone and select the Contacts tab</p><p>Step 2: Tap the vertical ellipses and select Import&#x2F; Export.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-4.jpg"                      alt="export contacts from old android to new"                ></p><p>This particular option can vary by your phone model and Android flavor, this is on Android 7 running on Motorola G4 Play. If you are unable to find a way to select contacts or share contacts in the Phone app on your phone, use the Contacts app on your phone for the same effect.</p><p>Step 3: A popup will emerge:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="select share all contacts to transfer contacts"                ></p><p>Select Share All Contacts.</p><p>Step 4: When you do that, this will come up:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-6.jpg"                      alt="select bluetooth as the method to share with"                ></p><p>Select Bluetooth in the Share With menu.

Glad you asked. Because there are other ways to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another that do not use Bluetooth and can be both seamless and more powerful than the Bluetooth method, depending on your tastes and needs.</p><h3 id="II-I-Sync-Contacts-Using-Google-Account"><a href="#II-I-Sync-Contacts-Using-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account"></a>II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account</h3><p>This is another method to transfer your contacts on one Android device and restore them on another Android device. Here’s how to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Google Sync:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings on your old device</p><p>Step 2: Tap Accounts</p><p>Step 3: Tap the account you want to transfer contacts from</p><p>Step 4: Make sure that there is a checkmark next to Contacts, or, in other words, Contacts sync is enabled&#x2F; toggled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-9.jpg"                      alt="enable contacts sync in google account settings"                ></p><p>Now, Google will sync your contacts from the OnePlus 12R device onto the cloud, and your new device signed into the same Google Account will automatically download the contacts.</p><h3 id="II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps"><a href="#II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps"></a>II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps</h3><p>Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from OnePlus 12R to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the OnePlus 12R devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the OnePlus 12R devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the OnePlus 12R devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the OnePlus 12R devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-OnePlus-12R-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-OnePlus-12R-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-OnePlus-12R-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-OnePlus-12R-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from OnePlus 12R to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from OnePlus 12R to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-oneplus-ace-2-pro-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Text Messages from OnePlus Ace 2 Pro to New Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-tecno-phantom-v-flip-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Transfer Text Messages from Tecno Phantom V Flip to iPhone 15/14/13/12/11/X/8/ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-music-from-honor-x9a-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Music from Honor X9a to iPod | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-oppo-find-x6-pro-to-iphone-xs11-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Oppo Find X6 Pro to iPhone XS/11 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-to-apple-how-to-transfer-photos-from-oppo-f23-5g-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Android to Apple How To Transfer Photos From Oppo F23 5G to iPad Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-lava-yuva-2-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Text Messages from Lava Yuva 2 to New Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-use-phone-clone-to-migrate-your-poco-f5-5g-data-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Use Phone Clone to Migrate Your Poco F5 5G Data? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/transform-your-screen-pip-tutorials-for-macos-enthusiasts-for-2024/"><u>Transform Your Screen  PIP Tutorials for macOS Enthusiasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/all-about-factory-reset-what-is-it-and-what-it-does-to-your-nokia-g22-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>All About Factory Reset, What Is It and What It Does to Your Nokia G22? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-going-against-the-grain-instagram-video-reversal/"><u>In 2024, Going Against the Grain  Instagram Video Reversal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-effortless-video-capturing-on-win11-os/"><u>2024 Approved  Effortless Video Capturing on Win11 OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-troubleshooting-obs-fullscreen-failure/"><u>[New] In 2024, Troubleshooting OBS Fullscreen Failure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exploring-the-best-text-to-speech-online-tools-to-use/"><u>New 2024 Approved Exploring The Best Text-to-Speech Online Tools To Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-urban-beats-on-tiktok-the-best-rap-collabs/"><u>[Updated] Urban Beats on TikTok  The Best Rap Collabs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-to-downloading-and-using-windows-movie-maker/"><u>New In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide to Downloading and Using Windows Movie Maker</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from OnePlus 12 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from OnePlus 12 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your OnePlus 12 to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.</p><p>Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device.

How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11 5G to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11 5G to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the OnePlus 11 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your OnePlus 11 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from OnePlus 11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your OnePlus 11 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your OnePlus 11 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your OnePlus 11 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Click “Accept “to establish connection.</p><p>3. After both devices have successfully been paired to each other, go to the folder containing the Photos your want to send to your new Android device. Select the photo or if they are more than one, long press on a photo. This will create a thumbnail.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.</p><p>Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device. Most users are at a loss about how to transfer their photos from one android device to another. There are several ways to do that successfully without the risk of losing your priced photos.

How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11R to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11R to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11R to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the OnePlus 11R devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your OnePlus 11R, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11R to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from OnePlus 11R to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your OnePlus 11R to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11R to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your OnePlus 11R, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 11R to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your OnePlus 11R from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth"></a>Part 3. Transfer Photos between Android Phones by Bluetooth</h2><p>The Presence of Bluetooth technology in phones is as old as android itself. The use of this technology offers another method that you can employ in transferring your photos from your OnePlus 11R to your new android device. It is a short and simple method that is known to most android users.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to guide you through the process of successfully transferring your photos from your OnePlus 11R to your new android device. This process involves navigating to the Bluetooth option on your device, connecting to your new device and initiating transfer. The steps are outlined below</p><p>1.

Click “Accept “to establish connection.</p><p>3. After both devices have successfully been paired to each other, go to the folder containing the Photos your want to send to your new Android device. Select the photo or if they are more than one, long press on a photo. This will create a thumbnail. Select the photos you want to transfer and choose the share button normally depicted by this icon</p><p>4. A list of option will appear. Choose Bluetooth. This will take you back to The Bluetooth application. Click on your new android device that you have previously paired with. A Message will appear on your new device asking for permission to receive the photos from your OnePlus 11R. Click “Accept”. This will initiate the transfer process.

How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus Ace 2 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus Ace 2 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus Ace 2 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the OnePlus Ace 2 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your OnePlus Ace 2, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus Ace 2 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from OnePlus Ace 2 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your OnePlus Ace 2 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus Ace 2 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your OnePlus Ace 2, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus Ace 2 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your OnePlus Ace 2 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

You’ll need to follow these steps to transfer data from your old phone to your PC and from your PC to your new Pixel 8&#x2F;8 Pro device:</p><ol><li><p>Connect your old Samsung device to your PC via USB.</p></li><li><p>Tap the phone’s notification and select <strong>File Transfer</strong>under the “Use USB for” option.</p></li><li><p>Access its memory through the computer’s File Explorer.</p></li><li><p>Select the files and folders you want to copy and transfer them to a new folder on your PC. You can then go through these files on your PC, delete what you don’t need, and organize everything before transferring the data to your new Pixel 8 device, but this is optional.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-14.jpg"                      alt="copy data to the pc"                ></p></li><li><p>Disconnect the old phone from the computer.</p></li><li><p>Connect your new Pixel phone to the PC.</p></li><li><p>Once again, click the phone’s notification and select the <strong>File Transfer</strong></p></li><li><p>Transfer the contents of your computer’s folder onto the new device.</p></li><li><p>Disconnect the new device after your files have been copied.</p></li></ol><p>You’ll need to consider which types of files go into which folders. For example, you’ll need to ensure that music data goes into Android’s Music folder, pictures and videos go into Camera or DCIM folders, and documents and downloads have their respective folders, which are typical on Android.</p><h2 id="Copy-Data-From-Samsung-to-Pixel-8-Pro-via-Quick-Switch"><a href="#Copy-Data-From-Samsung-to-Pixel-8-Pro-via-Quick-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch"></a>Copy Data From Samsung to Pixel 8 Pro via Quick Switch</h2><p>Another excellent option for transferring files to any Pixel phone is with Google’s Quick Switch adapters. These free OTG devices are included in every Pixel phone box and are designed to help you transfer data from an old phone to a new Pixel device.</p><p>A Quick Switch adapter connects to your Pixel phone, and you can insert a Samsung-compatible USB cable on the other end to start the transfer process.</p><p>Here’s what you’ll need to do:</p><ol><li><p>Power on your new Pixel 8&#x2F;8 Pro phone and click <strong>Start</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Plug the Quick Switch adapter into the Pixel device and connect the USB cable with the USB-A end into the Quick Switch. Connect the other end to the Samsung phone.</p></li><li><p>Unlock your Samsung device and click the <strong>Copy</strong></p></li><li><p>Select the type of data you want to transfer and hit <strong>Copy</strong>.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-15.jpg"                      alt="copy data with quick switch adapter"                ></p></li><li><p>Once the process is complete, click <strong>Next</strong> &gt; <strong>Done</strong>.</p></li></ol><p>Before you start the file transfer process using a Quick Switch, you should ensure both devices are fully charged. Furthermore, you should also update your Samsung device to the latest software version to avoid potential transfer issues, such as data corruption or incomplete transfers.</p><h2 id="Transfer-Data-From-Samsung-to-Pixel-Using-Google-Drive"><a href="#Transfer-Data-From-Samsung-to-Pixel-Using-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Transfer Data From Samsung to Pixel Using Google Drive"></a>Transfer Data From Samsung to Pixel Using Google Drive</h2><p>Being an Android user requires a Google account, granting you access to 15 GB of free storage space on Google Drive, making the app an excellent way to transfer files from your old phone to your new one. Here’s how you can use it:</p><ol><li><p>Using your old Samsung phone, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Accounts and Backup</strong>&gt; <strong>Back up data</strong> under <strong>Google Drive</strong>.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-16.jpg"                      alt="back up google drive data"                ></p></li><li><p>Change the <strong>Backup details</strong>and add the types of data you want to back up.</p></li><li><p>Hit the <strong>Back up now</strong>button and give your phone time to upload everything to Google Drive. You can watch the progress at the top of your screen.</p></li><li><p>Power on your new Pixel 8&#x2F;8 Pro device and follow the on-screen setup instructions.</p></li><li><p>Log in with the same Google account you used on the Samsung phone.</p></li><li><p>The new device will immediately recognize older backups.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-17.jpg"                      alt="restore from a google drive backup"                ></p></li><li><p>Choose the latest backup made on your Samsung phone and tap <strong>Restore</strong>to copy data from Samsung to Pixel.</p></li></ol><p>It’s worth noting that Google Drive users aren’t limited to 15 GB of storage space, as paid plans also include 100 GB and 200 GB options for a few dollars per month, making this type of transfer incredibly efficient.</p><h2 id="Transfer-Data-From-Samsung-to-Google-Pixel-8-8-Pro-Using-Email"><a href="#Transfer-Data-From-Samsung-to-Google-Pixel-8-8-Pro-Using-Email" class="headerlink" title="Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email"></a>Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email</h2><p>Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:</p><ol><li><p>Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.</p></li><li><p>Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg"                      alt="transfer data via email attachments"                ></p></li><li><p>Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.</p></li><li><p>Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.</p></li></ol><p>Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Transferring data from one smartphone to another can be challenging, especially if you’re new to the whole thing or do it manually. To help you out, we’ve prepared the top seven methods for handling data transfers from Samsung to Google Pixel, which include the built-in data transfer tool during device setup, USB cables, Quick Switch adapter, Google Drive, email, and a dedicated third-party app – Wondershare Dr.Fone.</p><p>As you can see, it’s your safest bet, ensuring the most straightforward and fastest data transfer between your old and new device. This way, you won’t need to organize and transfer anything manually or risk losing data, and Wondershare Dr.Fone can be used even after the initial device setup.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-you-transfer-files-from-realme-c55-to-iphone-151413-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can You Transfer Files From Realme C55 To iPhone 15/14/13? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data After Switching From Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro to Latest Samsung | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-to-blackberry-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Samsung Galaxy S23+ to BlackBerry | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-to-apple-how-to-transfer-photos-from-vivo-v27-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Android to Apple How To Transfer Photos From Vivo V27 to iPad Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-migrate-android-data-from-lava-yuva-3-pro-to-new-android-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Migrate Android Data From Lava Yuva 3 Pro to New Android Phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-motorola-g24-power-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Motorola G24 Power to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-to-apple-how-to-transfer-photos-from-infinix-note-30-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Android to Apple How To Transfer Photos From Infinix Note 30 to iPad Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-the-power-of-cross-platform-social-media-with-youtube-and-instagram-stories/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking the Power of Cross-Platform Social Media with YouTube & Instagram Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-create-a-digital-signature-and-certificate-for-jpg-by-ldigisigner-sign-a-jpg-sign-a-jpg/"><u>How to create a digital signature and certificate for .jpg</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-most-acclaimed-ipad-recording-software-3p/"><u>2024 Approved  Most Acclaimed iPad Recording Software 3P</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/unleashing-the-power-of-edit-in-tiktok-video-creation/"><u>Unleashing the Power of Edit in TikTok Video Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-elite-selection-of-fbs-best-viewing-apps-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elite Selection of FB's Best Viewing Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/passfab-apple-iphone-se-2020-backup-unlocker-top-4-alternatives-by-drfone-ios/"><u>PassFab Apple iPhone SE (2020) Backup Unlocker Top 4 Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/capture-clarity-with-leading-photo-gridding-services-for-2024/"><u>Capture Clarity with Leading Photo Gridding Services for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-refine-and-revamp-your-videos-using-youtube-studio-tools/"><u>In 2024, Refine and Revamp Your Videos Using YouTube Studio Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-guide-to-synchronizing-your-audio-and-videos-properly/"><u>New 2024 Approved Guide to Synchronizing Your Audio And Videos Properly?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the OnePlus 12 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your OnePlus 12, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your OnePlus 12 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your OnePlus 12, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from OnePlus 12 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your OnePlus 12 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The advantage of this is that apps can be downloaded quickly, and also without costing you in terms of data roaming charges.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/download-app-with-mobogenie.jpg"                      alt="usb android file transfer"                ></p><p>A neat feature is the ability to uninstall apps that came preloaded on the phone as often we find ourselves with apps that we never use that we cannot delete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/uninstall-app-with-mobogenie.jpg"                      alt="use transfer android file"                ></p><p>The transfer of photo files is straightforward, and several photos can be selected from your computer to import onto your device at once, or vice versa.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/transfer-photos-with-mobogenie.jpg"                      alt="usb to android file transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Free.</li><li>Support wireless connection of devices on the same network (although temperamental).</li><li>Support multiple devices.</li><li>Download apps onto it through app store.</li><li>Simple to use.</li></ul><p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p>Download MoboRobo and install this Android USB file transfer tool on your computer. Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your OnePlus 11 5G with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your OnePlus 11 5G as well.</p><p>Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg"                      alt="USB android file transfer"                ></p><p>As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.</p><p>We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your OnePlus 11 5G with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-itel-a60s-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Itel A60s to Samsung Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-poco-f5-pro-5g-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Poco F5 Pro 5G to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-realme-10t-5g-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Realme 10T 5G to Samsung Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-realme-c67-4g-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Text Messages from Realme C67 4G to New Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-asus-rog-phone-8-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Asus ROG Phone 8 to Other Android Devices Using Bluetooth? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-teach-you-to-transfer-files-from-oppo-find-x7-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways To Teach You To Transfer Files from Oppo Find X7 to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-oppo-find-x6-to-outlook-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Oppo Find X6 to Outlook | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-easiest-guide-how-to-clone-motorola-moto-e13-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Easiest Guide How to Clone Motorola Moto E13 Phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevate-your-gaming-by-recording-ps3-games/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevate Your Gaming by Recording PS3 Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/sculpting-a-specialized-niche-for-youtube-content-for-2024/"><u>Sculpting a Specialized Niche for YouTube Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/sculpting-success-in-visual-communications-for-2024/"><u>Sculpting Success in Visual Communications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-comprehensive-tips-for-monitoring-subscriber-engagement/"><u>[New] Comprehensive Tips for Monitoring Subscriber Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/nokia-data-retrieval-tool-restore-lost-data-from-nokia-c12-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>Nokia Data Retrieval tool – restore lost data from Nokia C12 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-make-animation-talk-explained-with-easy-steps/"><u>New 2024 Approved How To Make Animation Talk?
