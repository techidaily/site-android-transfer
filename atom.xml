How to Transfer Photos from Poco C51 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Poco C51 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C51 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Poco C51 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Poco C51, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C51 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Poco C51 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Poco C51 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C51 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Poco C51, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C51 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Poco C51 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Glad you asked. Because there are other ways to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another that do not use Bluetooth and can be both seamless and more powerful than the Bluetooth method, depending on your tastes and needs.</p><h3 id="II-I-Sync-Contacts-Using-Google-Account"><a href="#II-I-Sync-Contacts-Using-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account"></a>II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account</h3><p>This is another method to transfer your contacts on one Android device and restore them on another Android device. Here’s how to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Google Sync:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings on your old device</p><p>Step 2: Tap Accounts</p><p>Step 3: Tap the account you want to transfer contacts from</p><p>Step 4: Make sure that there is a checkmark next to Contacts, or, in other words, Contacts sync is enabled&#x2F; toggled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-9.jpg"                      alt="enable contacts sync in google account settings"                ></p><p>Now, Google will sync your contacts from the Poco C50 device onto the cloud, and your new device signed into the same Google Account will automatically download the contacts.</p><h3 id="II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps"><a href="#II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps"></a>II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps</h3><p>Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Poco C50 to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Poco C50 devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Poco C50 devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Poco C50 devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Poco C50 devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Poco-C50-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Poco-C50-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Poco-C50-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Poco-C50-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Poco C50 to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-poco-x5-pro-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Poco X5 Pro to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-oppo-k11-5g-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-photos-from-honor-play-7t-to-laptop-without-usb-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Photos from Honor Play 7T to Laptop Without USB | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-vivo-v27-pro-to-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Vivo V27 Pro To Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-techniques-to-transfer-data-from-tecno-pova-5-to-iphone-15141312-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Techniques to Transfer Data from Tecno Pova 5 to iPhone 15/14/13/12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-poco-c51-to-blackberry-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Poco C51 to BlackBerry | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-vivo-s17e-to-laptop-without-usb-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Vivo S17e to Laptop Without USB | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-an-unresponsive-nokia-c32-screen-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide How to Fix an Unresponsive Nokia C32 Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-the-analytical-approach-to-youtube-content-performance/"><u>In 2024, The Analytical Approach to YouTube Content Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-capture-twitter-gifs-on-your-computer-quickly/"><u>[New] Capture Twitter Gifs on Your Computer Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-exploring-the-top-viral-tweets-of-the-year/"><u>[New] In 2024, Exploring the Top Viral Tweets of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-unraveling-the-imovie-video-edge-policy/"><u>[Updated] Unraveling the iMovie Video Edge Policy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/free-ai-powered-face-makers-no-download-required/"><u>Free AI-Powered Face Makers No Download Required</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-the-complete-tiktok-siri-interaction-manual/"><u>[Updated] The Complete TikTok Siri Interaction Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/unlocking-tiktoks-1-gamer-list/"><u>Unlocking TikTok's #1 Gamer List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-skype-voice-changer-5-useful-tools-to-change-voice-for-skype/"><u>New In 2024, Skype Voice Changer 5 Useful Tools to Change Voice for Skype</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

How to Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Tap Pair on your old device to pair the two devices together using Bluetooth.</p><p>Step 6: After pairing is complete, both devices will show under paired devices on each other:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-3.jpg"                      alt="old device showing paired android"                ></p><p>And that’s how simple it is to pair devices to each other using Bluetooth!</p><h3 id="I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth"><a href="#I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth"></a>I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth</h3><p>Here is how to transfer contacts from one Android to another, easily, using Bluetooth:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Phone on your old phone and select the Contacts tab</p><p>Step 2: Tap the vertical ellipses and select Import&#x2F; Export.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-4.jpg"                      alt="export contacts from old android to new"                ></p><p>This particular option can vary by your phone model and Android flavor, this is on Android 7 running on Motorola G4 Play. If you are unable to find a way to select contacts or share contacts in the Phone app on your phone, use the Contacts app on your phone for the same effect.</p><p>Step 3: A popup will emerge:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="select share all contacts to transfer contacts"                ></p><p>Select Share All Contacts.</p><p>Step 4: When you do that, this will come up:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-6.jpg"                      alt="select bluetooth as the method to share with"                ></p><p>Select Bluetooth in the Share With menu.

Glad you asked. Because there are other ways to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another that do not use Bluetooth and can be both seamless and more powerful than the Bluetooth method, depending on your tastes and needs.</p><h3 id="II-I-Sync-Contacts-Using-Google-Account"><a href="#II-I-Sync-Contacts-Using-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account"></a>II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account</h3><p>This is another method to transfer your contacts on one Android device and restore them on another Android device. Here’s how to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Google Sync:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings on your old device</p><p>Step 2: Tap Accounts</p><p>Step 3: Tap the account you want to transfer contacts from</p><p>Step 4: Make sure that there is a checkmark next to Contacts, or, in other words, Contacts sync is enabled&#x2F; toggled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-9.jpg"                      alt="enable contacts sync in google account settings"                ></p><p>Now, Google will sync your contacts from the Poco C50 device onto the cloud, and your new device signed into the same Google Account will automatically download the contacts.</p><h3 id="II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps"><a href="#II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps"></a>II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps</h3><p>Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Poco C50 to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Poco C50 devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Poco C50 devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Poco C50 devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Poco C50 devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Poco-C50-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Poco-C50-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Poco-C50-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Poco-C50-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Poco C50 to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-oppo-a1x-5g-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Oppo A1x 5G to Other Android Devices Using Bluetooth?

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Reno 11 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Oppo Reno 11 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Reno 11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Oppo Reno 11 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Oppo Reno 11 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo Reno 11 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.</p><p>Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device.

How to Transfer Photos from Poco C55 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Poco C55 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C55 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Poco C55 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Poco C55, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C55 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Poco C55 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Poco C55 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C55 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Poco C55, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C55 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Poco C55 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Poco F5 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Poco F5 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco F5 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Poco F5 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Poco F5 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco F5 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Poco F5 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco F5 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Poco F5 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Reno 9A devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><ul><li>On your Oppo Reno 9A, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 9A to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><ul><li>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Reno 9A to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><ul><li>Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon.

NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.</li></ul><p>To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 9A to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 9A to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent.

However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.</p><p>We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Oppo Reno 9A with ease.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone. This also means most of these photos are stored on the phone memory.</p><p>Most of these photos would need to be shared with other people who are either a part of the photo or you would want to transfer them to your new android device. Most users are at a loss about how to transfer their photos from one android device to another. There are several ways to do that successfully without the risk of losing your priced photos.

How to Transfer Photos from Poco C65 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Poco C65 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C65 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Poco C65 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Poco C65, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C65 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Poco C65 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Poco C65 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C65 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Poco C65, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C65 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Poco C65 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off.

How to Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to Transfer Photos from Poco C50 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Poco C50 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Poco C50 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Poco C50, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Poco C50 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Poco C50 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2.
