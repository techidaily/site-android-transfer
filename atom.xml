With this tool, you will transfer various android data such as camera photos, contacts, message history, mail accounts, calendars, and videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/phone-transfer/move-to-ios-2.jpg"                      alt="move to ios"                ></p><p>Move to iOS app works on android version 4.0 or higher. You can transfer data to any iPhone in a relatively straightforward process. Also, beware that the Move to iOS will work only when setting up a new iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Besides knowing what the content that Moves to iOS tool can transfer, you might be wondering how long the process can take. Depending on the content you want to transfer, the process generally takes around 10 – 30 minutes. However, other factors can determine the time the app will take to move content to iOS. They include the speed of the network, patency of the transmission process, and Wi-Fi stability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/phone-transfer/move-to-ios-5.jpg"                      alt="android move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Move-to-iOS-not-working-problem-lists"><a href="#Part-1-Move-to-iOS-not-working-problem-lists" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists"></a>Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists</h2><p>Users can learn to use the Move to iOS app quickly.

You can also reboot your devices if the error is temporary.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS could not communicate correctly with the Nokia C02 devices.</strong></li></ul><p>To avoid this Move to iOS error, ensure both devices run on updated operating systems, i.e., android 4.0 or later and iOS 9 or later. The phones must have enough power, and lastly, ensure that you turn off background apps to avoid notifications during the transfer process.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS stuck on preparing&#x2F;transferring.</strong></li></ul><p>You are transferring your android data to iOS, but the process is stuck on the transferring page. The problem is related to Wi-Fi connections. Should the Wi-Fi disconnect for a few seconds, the transfer process stops. Other distractions on android such as calls, switching to sleep mode, or other background operations might also cause the Move to iOS error.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS takes forever&#x2F;slow.</strong></li></ul><p>The length of time taken to transfer data from android to iOS depends on the size of the data and Wi-Fi connection. To speed up the transfer, check your Wi-Fi connection, delete unnecessary data from the android device, or restart the transfer if it takes too long.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS Wi-Fi disconnect.</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi drops will obviously interfere with the transfer process.

It is a great way o eliminate minor issues during data transfer from android to iOS devices. The process can resolve the Move to iOS stuck on connecting to iPhone issues. A simple restart will eliminate the bugs and any cached error in the Nokia C02 devices.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Clear-all-running-apps"><a href="#Tip-2-Clear-all-running-apps" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Clear all running apps"></a>Tip 2: Clear all running apps</h3><p>It is recommended to avoid using the android device o run applications when using the Move to iOS app. Since the app runs in the foreground, you should ensure all other apps in the android are disabled before starting the data transfer process. Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-Make-sure-the-Wi-Fi-connection-is-turned-on"><a href="#Tip-3-Make-sure-the-Wi-Fi-connection-is-turned-on" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on"></a>Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on</h3><p>Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone’s private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power"><a href="#Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Plug both devices to power"></a>Tip 4: Plug both devices to power</h3><p>You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Nokia C02 devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode"><a href="#Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode"></a>Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode</h3><p>When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.</p><p>The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement"><a href="#Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Check the storage requirement"></a>Tip 6: Check the storage requirement</h3><p>Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don’t need to transfer from your android device before getting started.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer"><a href="#Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer"></a>Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer</h3><p>Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices"><a href="#Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices"></a>Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices</h3><p>You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store. Generally, the app runs on Android 4.0 and above while transferring data to iOS 9.0 or later devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-9-Turn-off-battery-optimization"><a href="#Tip-9-Turn-off-battery-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization"></a>Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization</h3><p>Turning off the battery optimization on both your Android and iOS device is a requirement when using the Move to iOS tool. The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode. Therefore you should ensure the feature is closed from the settings of your android device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

But generally speaking, we can’t deny that any process that involves the migration of data is sensitive in nature. That’s why it’s important to prepare both devices before officially initiating the data transfer process. Here are some reminders you need to keep in mind before you export contacts from Nokia C02 to iPhone.</p><ul><li>Make sure your iPhone is fully charged and carrying enough internal storage.</li><li>Incoming phone calls might interrupt the data transfer process in some ways. Hence, it’s best to turn the Airplane mode on both devices while the contacts are being migrated.</li><li>Don’t use both devices once the data transfer has started.</li><li>Lastly, create a backup file for your contact list. You never know what’s going to happen with the transfer. It’s best to be prepared to avoid data loss. Don’t worry. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>has a file backup feature that can help you a lot.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Data transfer is a sensitive procedure.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Honor X50 GT to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Honor X50 GT to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Honor X50 GT. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Honor X50 GT to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. At this point, select the option that reads “Move Data from Android.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Honor X50 GT. Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Honor X50 GT, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Honor X50 GT to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the Honor X50 GT devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Honor X50 GT before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Honor X50 GT, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone’s private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power"><a href="#Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Plug both devices to power"></a>Tip 4: Plug both devices to power</h3><p>You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode"><a href="#Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode"></a>Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode</h3><p>When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.</p><p>The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement"><a href="#Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Check the storage requirement"></a>Tip 6: Check the storage requirement</h3><p>Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don’t need to transfer from your android device before getting started.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer"><a href="#Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer"></a>Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer</h3><p>Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices"><a href="#Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices"></a>Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices</h3><p>You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store. Generally, the app runs on Android 4.0 and above while transferring data to iOS 9.0 or later devices.</p><h3 id="Tip-9-Turn-off-battery-optimization"><a href="#Tip-9-Turn-off-battery-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization"></a>Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization</h3><p>Turning off the battery optimization on both your Android and iOS device is a requirement when using the Move to iOS tool.

They include the speed of the network, patency of the transmission process, and Wi-Fi stability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/phone-transfer/move-to-ios-5.jpg"                      alt="android move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Move-to-iOS-not-working-problem-lists"><a href="#Part-1-Move-to-iOS-not-working-problem-lists" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists"></a>Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists</h2><p>Users can learn to use the Move to iOS app quickly.

Despite the fact that the iPod is an Apple product, transferring its music to an Android device is indeed possible. Apple’s ecosystem may be renowned for its exclusivity, but with the right methods, you can seamlessly bridge the gap between your iPod and an Android device.</p><p>One of the most straightforward ways to transfer music from your iPod to an Android device is by using Bluetooth. It’s worth noting that Bluetooth transfer capability is present in all iPod Touch models but not in older iPod models. Bluetooth support for iPod Touch was introduced with the 2nd Generation and iOS 3.0, while iPod Nano gained support from the 7th Generation onward.</p><p>Alternatively, other methods involve employing a dedicated app and third-party software as an intermediary. Rest assured; the upcoming sections will comprehensively cover these approaches, providing you with the necessary guidance for a smooth music transfer process.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Transfer-Music-from-iPod-to-Android-via-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-1-Transfer-Music-from-iPod-to-Android-via-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Ensure that both your iPod and Android devices can do Bluetooth transfer. This method is also applicable when you wonder <strong>how to download music from an iPod to an Android phone</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enable Bluetooth on both Devices.</p><p>On your iPod, navigate to the Settings menu and select Bluetooth.

Make sure that you have set both devices to discoverable mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pair the Realme Note 50 devices.</p><p>Search for available Bluetooth devices on your Realme Note 50, and select your iPod from the list. Likewise, confirm the pairing request on your iPod.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Initiate file transfer.</p><p>Once paired, locate the music files on your iPod that you wish to transfer. Use the sharing or send via Bluetooth option (this may vary depending on your iPod model) to send the selected music files to your Realme Note 50.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Accept the files on Android.</p><p>Accept the incoming Bluetooth transfer request from the iPod. The music files will then be transferred wirelessly from your iPod to the Android device.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Verify transfer success.</p><p>Confirm the successful transfer by checking the music library on your Realme Note 50.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G.

Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code.

With the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Realme GT 3 to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Realme GT 3 to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Realme GT 3. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Realme GT 3 to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. At this point, select the option that reads “Move Data from Android.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Realme GT 3. Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Realme GT 3, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Realme GT 3 to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the Realme GT 3 devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process, and you’re done.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="move data from android with move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Realme-GT-3-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer"><a href="#How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Realme-GT-3-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How To Move Text Messages From Realme GT 3 to iPhone Quickly with Computer"></a>How To Move Text Messages From Realme GT 3 to iPhone Quickly with Computer</h2><p>If you’re looking for a swift and reliable way to move text messages from Realme GT 3 to iPhone, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone can be the perfect go-to solution.</p><p>Packed with a user-friendly interface, this software streamlines the process, ensuring a quick and efficient transfer of your messages through its Phone Transfer feature.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Realme GT 3 before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Realme GT 3, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

It is boring to transfer the files from one place to another, and the time it takes is a real pain in the neck. And also, it is impossible to transfer apps from Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition to BlackBerry because of different operating systems. Sometimes, not even all photos, videos and music files will be compatible. But, luckily, the BlackBerry developers have thought of a one way, which is simpler than the manual transfer mentioned above, to transfer your data from Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition to BlackBerry.

Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-Make-sure-the-Wi-Fi-connection-is-turned-on"><a href="#Tip-3-Make-sure-the-Wi-Fi-connection-is-turned-on" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on"></a>Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on</h3><p>Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone’s private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power"><a href="#Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Plug both devices to power"></a>Tip 4: Plug both devices to power</h3><p>You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Itel P40 devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode"><a href="#Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode"></a>Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode</h3><p>When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.</p><p>The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement"><a href="#Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Check the storage requirement"></a>Tip 6: Check the storage requirement</h3><p>Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process.

However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.</p><p>We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Itel P40 with ease.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Oppo A2 to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Oppo A2 to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Oppo A2. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Oppo A2 to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. At this point, select the option that reads “Move Data from Android.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Oppo A2. Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Oppo A2, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Oppo A2 to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the Oppo A2 devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone. Follow the instructions to complete the setup process, and you’re done.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="move data from android with move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Oppo-A2-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer"><a href="#How-To-Move-Text-Messages-From-Oppo-A2-to-iPhone-Quickly-with-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How To Move Text Messages From Oppo A2 to iPhone Quickly with Computer"></a>How To Move Text Messages From Oppo A2 to iPhone Quickly with Computer</h2><p>If you’re looking for a swift and reliable way to move text messages from Oppo A2 to iPhone, third-party software like Wondershare Dr.Fone can be the perfect go-to solution.</p><p>Packed with a user-friendly interface, this software streamlines the process, ensuring a quick and efficient transfer of your messages through its Phone Transfer feature.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Oppo A2 before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process.

Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Oppo A2 device to display.</li><li>Tap on “Menu” and then on “Merge Accounts”</li><li>Select Google Merge. This will merge all your Contacts with Google.</li><li>Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting “Contacts to Display”, then “All Contacts”</li><li>This should make all the contacts on your device to appear, and your sync problem should also be solved.</li></ol><p>These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account. It is also worthy of note that if you want new contacts to be saved automatically to your Google account, you have to select the Google Account option when prompted on where to save the new contact, or else, the contact will not be automatically synced to your Gmail account, and you will have to create an export to add it to your Google Contacts.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that it might take a longer period of time for the contacts to synchronize to Google on a slower network connection, in deviance to a fast network connection, so you might need to exercise some patience if you’re on a slower Internet connection.</p><p>It can sometimes be bewildering and baffling when people probably lose their phones, and then they complain of loss of contacts. However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts. All the methods mentioned above are easy to execute and will help you transfer contacts from the phone to Gmail in a snap.</p><p>Lastly, you can also use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html" >Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for smoothly exporting contacts from Oppo A2 to Gmail.</p><h2 id="4-Ways-to-Transfer-Music-from-Oppo-A2-to-iPhone"><a href="#4-Ways-to-Transfer-Music-from-Oppo-A2-to-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="4 Ways to Transfer Music from Oppo A2 to iPhone"></a>4 Ways to Transfer Music from Oppo A2 to iPhone</h2><p><em>You switch from an Android device to an iPhone but can’t find an ideal solution to transfer music from Oppo A2 to iPhone.</em></p><p>Welcome to the club!

It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.</p><h3 id="File-Size"><a href="#File-Size" class="headerlink" title="File Size"></a>File Size</h3><p>The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Sony Xperia 5 V device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry.

If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Sony Xperia 5 V to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><ul><li>Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.</li></ul><p>To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Sony Xperia 5 V to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Sony Xperia 5 V to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent.

Also, both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm the completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><p>Now, we’ll discuss how to transfer contacts from one Android to another with the help of a SIM card.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-transfer-contacts-from-Sony-Xperia-5-V-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-SIM-card"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-transfer-contacts-from-Sony-Xperia-5-V-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-SIM-card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to transfer contacts from Sony Xperia 5 V to Other Android Devices using SIM card?"></a>Part 2: How to transfer contacts from Sony Xperia 5 V to Other Android Devices using SIM card?</h2><p>Here are the steps which will help you.</p><ul><li>To copy the contacts to your SIM card, you should follow the sequence –</li><li>Go to “contact” on your old device.</li><li>Then tap on “More” and then choose “settings”.</li><li>Here you can find “import &#x2F; Export” option.

Depending on the content you want to transfer, the process generally takes around 10 – 30 minutes. However, other factors can determine the time the app will take to move content to iOS. They include the speed of the network, patency of the transmission process, and Wi-Fi stability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/phone-transfer/move-to-ios-5.jpg"                      alt="android move to ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Move-to-iOS-not-working-problem-lists"><a href="#Part-1-Move-to-iOS-not-working-problem-lists" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists"></a>Part 1: Move to iOS not working problem lists</h2><p>Users can learn to use the Move to iOS app quickly.

Proceed to set up your iOS device using the onscreen steps.</p><p>If you are not receiving any code on your iOS device, you can fix it by ensuring the Wi-Fi is always on throughout the process. You can also reboot your devices if the error is temporary.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS could not communicate correctly with the Infinix Hot 30 5G devices.</strong></li></ul><p>To avoid this Move to iOS error, ensure both devices run on updated operating systems, i.e., android 4.0 or later and iOS 9 or later. The phones must have enough power, and lastly, ensure that you turn off background apps to avoid notifications during the transfer process.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS stuck on preparing&#x2F;transferring.</strong></li></ul><p>You are transferring your android data to iOS, but the process is stuck on the transferring page. The problem is related to Wi-Fi connections. Should the Wi-Fi disconnect for a few seconds, the transfer process stops. Other distractions on android such as calls, switching to sleep mode, or other background operations might also cause the Move to iOS error.</p><ul><li><strong>Move to iOS takes forever&#x2F;slow.</strong></li></ul><p>The length of time taken to transfer data from android to iOS depends on the size of the data and Wi-Fi connection.

Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.</p><p>The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement"><a href="#Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Check the storage requirement"></a>Tip 6: Check the storage requirement</h3><p>Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don’t need to transfer from your android device before getting started.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer"><a href="#Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer"></a>Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer</h3><p>Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices"><a href="#Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices"></a>Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices</h3><p>You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store.

The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode. Therefore you should ensure the feature is closed from the settings of your android device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Move-to-iOS-not-working-solved-without-a-PC"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Move-to-iOS-not-working-solved-without-a-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: [Alternative] Move to iOS not working solved without a PC"></a>Part 3: [Alternative] Move to iOS not working solved without a PC</h2><p>An alternative solution to Move to iOS not working problem is to use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-transfer.html" >Dr. Fone – Phone Manager (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
