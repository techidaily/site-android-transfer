How to Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo K11x devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Oppo K11x, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo K11x to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Oppo K11x to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Oppo K11x, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo K11x from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Oppo K11 5G devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Oppo K11 5G devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Oppo K11 5G devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Oppo K11 5G devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Oppo-K11-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Oppo-K11-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Oppo-K11-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Oppo-K11-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Oppo K11 5G to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Data-After-Switching-From-Oppo-K11-5G-to-Latest-Samsung"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Data-After-Switching-From-Oppo-K11-5G-to-Latest-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Data After Switching From Oppo K11 5G to Latest Samsung"></a>How to Transfer Data After Switching From Oppo K11 5G to Latest Samsung</h2><p>Have you finally gotten your hands on the latest smartphone from Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S series?

Use an SD Card"></a>7. Use an SD Card</h3><p>We can almost see you fumbling with your Samsung S23, looking for an SD or microSD card slot. Newsflash: there isn’t one. Like its predecessors, S21 and S22, the Galaxy S23 series doesn’t support expandable storage.</p><p>How can you transfer data from an SD card, then? Well, there’s always your computer. You can migrate your SD card data to your desktop or laptop before moving it to your new Galaxy phone.</p><p>It may not be as straightforward as the methods above, but it’s ideal for keeping precious files from your old Android’s SD card. Here’s what to do:</p><ol><li>Select the desired files or folders on your old Android, tap <strong>Move</strong>, and choose your <strong>SD card</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-18.jpg"                      alt="moving files to an sd card"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Connect the Android to your computer with a USB cable.</li><li>Tap <strong>USB for file transfer</strong>in the <strong>Notification panel</strong> and select <strong>Transferring files &#x2F; Android Auto</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-19.jpg"                      alt="choosing a usb for file transfer"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Go to <strong>This PC</strong>in <strong>File Explorer</strong> and open your phone under <strong>Devices and drives</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the folders or files you wish to move, select <strong>Copy</strong>, and paste them to any location on your computer.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-20.jpg"                      alt="transferring files to a pc"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>Once you move the data, safely disconnect your old Android and connect your Samsung S23 to the PC.</li><li>Go to the folder with your newly saved data and copy-paste it to your Samsung S23.</li></ol><p>This method is best for transferring photos, videos, and other files from an SD card you might not use anymore. After all, smartphone manufacturers increasingly ditch SD card slots for sleek, more compact designs.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Switching from Oppo K11 5G to Samsung S23 is a breeze because you have many data transfer options. Besides Samsung’s Smart Switch, you can use your synced Google Account, Google Drive, Bluetooth, or a USB-C to USB-C cable. You can also migrate data from your old Android SD card to your computer before transferring it to your new phone.</p><p>However, Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer might be your best option.

It is called the “Move to iOS app,” which you can download freely from the Google Play store.</p><p>Now to proceed, first of all, you need to do some settings on your iPhone device as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your iPhone, go to a screen called ‘Apps &amp; Data’ &gt; choose the ‘Move Data from Android’ option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer photos from android to iphone-app and data"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move data from android"                ></p><p>The next step is to take your Oppo K11x to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Switch to your Oppo K11x, open the Google Play Store, and search for the ‘Move to iOS’ app.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, tap Continue on both your iOS and Android devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move from android to ios"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> On your Oppo K11x, enter the 12-digit code of the iPhone. This is so that the ‘Move to iOS’ app knows which iOS device it has to transfer the data to.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="how to transfer photos from android to iphone-enrer the code"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Before the transfer starts, you will be asked several questions, like do you want to transfer Google Account information, Bookmarks, etc. Now, since you only wish to videos and photos, deselect the other options except ‘Camera Roll.’</li></ul><p>The above process to <strong>transfer pictures from Oppo K11x to iPhone</strong> is suitable for mobile users who are unwilling to invest money in software. However, the method is not perfect because it is time-consuming. The transaction can neither be done quickly nor can it be done with a single click.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This solution only works when you set up the iPhone. If the iPhone is already set up, you need to factory reset it and set it up to restore photos with this App. If you’d like to save existing data after transferring, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good solution.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Oppo-K11x-to-iPhone-via-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Oppo-K11x-to-iPhone-via-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to iPhone via Bluetooth"></a>Part 3: How to Transfer Photos from Oppo K11x to iPhone via Bluetooth</h2><p>Bluetooth is an excellent option to transfer photos and videos across both Android and iPhone devices. This is because Bluetooth is available on both Android and iOS devices, making it widely useful. Furthermore, you don’t have to download a third-party app to transfer pictures via Bluetooth. The process can also be completed quickly with just a few taps on the screen.</p><ul><li>If you are thinking about <strong>how to transfer pictures from Oppo K11x to iPhone</strong>, then follow the process outlined below.</li><li><strong>1.</strong> Open up Bluetooth on both Android and iOS devices. Both the smartphones should have the option to turn Bluetooth on&#x2F;off via a sliding panel from the top of the screen.</li><li><strong>2.</strong> Now, tap on the checkbox to make the Oppo K11x device visible to other mobile devices.</li><li><strong>3.</strong> On your Oppo K11x&gt; Go to your File Manager &gt; DCIM Folder (for Camera content).</li><li><strong>4.</strong> Tap on the menu button of your Android Smartphone to get a list of the drop-down menu actions.

One of the major developments is the introduction of the camera to mobile phones. The ease of carriage and portability has made mobile phone cameras a preference over digital cameras. As a result we are witnessing more pictures taken with the aid of a phone.

How to Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Find N3 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Oppo Find N3, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Oppo Find N3 to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Oppo Find N3, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo Find N3 from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Find N3 Flip devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Oppo Find N3 Flip, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Oppo Find N3 Flip to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Oppo Find N3 Flip, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo Find N3 Flip from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Find N3 Flip devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Oppo Find N3 Flip, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Oppo Find N3 Flip to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Oppo Find N3 Flip, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 Flip to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo Find N3 Flip from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

We will also provide a few tutorials on how to <strong>transfer data from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to iPhone 15</strong> conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Transferring-Data-From-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-iPhone"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Transferring-Data-From-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Oppo Find X7 Ultra to iPhone"></a>Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Oppo Find X7 Ultra to iPhone</h2><p>It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.</p><h3 id="File-Size"><a href="#File-Size" class="headerlink" title="File Size"></a>File Size</h3><p>The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.</p><h3 id="Device-Storage"><a href="#Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Device Storage"></a>Device Storage</h3><p>Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.</p><h3 id="Operating-Systems"><a href="#Operating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems"></a>Operating Systems</h3><p>Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to iPhone 15 conveniently.</p><h2 id="5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Oppo Find X7 Ultra to iPhone 15"></a>5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Oppo Find X7 Ultra to iPhone 15</h2><p>Sharing files between Android and iOS smartphones has become a lot easier today than ever before.

How to Transfer Photos from Old Android to New Android Using NFC"></a>Part 2. How to Transfer Photos from Old Android to New Android Using NFC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-01.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices-by NFC"                ></p><p>Near Field Communication(NFC) is a technology that supports Android Beam and is ideal for transferring data between android devices by just pressing their backs together. It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Find X7 Ultra devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><ul><li>On your Oppo Find X7 Ultra, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><ul><li>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><ul><li>Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.</li></ul><p>To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also, both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm the completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><p>Now, we’ll discuss how to transfer contacts from one Android to another with the help of a SIM card.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-transfer-contacts-from-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-SIM-card"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-transfer-contacts-from-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-SIM-card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices using SIM card?"></a>Part 2: How to transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices using SIM card?</h2><p>Here are the steps which will help you.</p><ul><li>To copy the contacts to your SIM card, you should follow the sequence –</li><li>Go to “contact” on your old device.</li><li>Then tap on “More” and then choose “settings”.</li><li>Here you can find “import &#x2F; Export” option. Tap on it and then choose “Export” option.</li><li>Now click on “Export to SIM card” option. On choosing this step, all your contacts will be copied to the SIM card in a few minutes. This depending upon the capacity of the SIM card.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/05/14945039336575.jpg"                      alt="export to sim card"                ></p><p>Now, pull the SIM card out and insert in on your new device.</p><p>• Here follow the same steps above and on “Import &#x2F; Export” option, choose “Import”. Then it will ask for the option to import from. Choose “SIM Card” here. Now, all your contacts will be imported to your phone memory from the SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/05/14945040941310.jpg"                      alt="import from sim card"                ></p><p>Advantages: This process is easy to use and can be done without any PC.</p><p>Disadvantage: It can only transfer the contacts up to the SIM capacity that is 200 to 250 in one time. If you have lots of contacts, it is impossible to transfer by this method.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-transfer-contacts-from-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-Bluetooth-or-Wi-Fi-Direct"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-transfer-contacts-from-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-Bluetooth-or-Wi-Fi-Direct" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct?"></a>Part 3: How to transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct?</h2><p>To transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct is one of the easiest methods. For this method, make sure that you should enable “Bluetooth” or “Wi-Fi Direct” on both the Android devices.</p><p>The steps:</p><p>1. Go to the “Contacts” menu on your old Android device.</p><p>2. Now, find “Import &#x2F; Export” option. It might be under “More” &gt; “Settings” menu. Tap on it.</p><p>3. Now go to “Share namecard via” option from the menu and select all the contacts to transfer process.</p><p>4. Now you have two options. Share via “Bluetooth” or ‘Wi-Fi Direct”. Select any option you want and accept from the other device.</p><p>5. After successful connection, all the contacts from old Android devices will be transferred to your new Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/05/14945041942239.jpg"                      alt="wifi direct"                ></p><p>This method is simple and easy to use.</p><p>There is yet another method to transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices using Samsung’s own app “Smart Switch”.</p><p>Advantage: This is a very fast process.</p><p>Disadvantage : Sometimes the contacts are not saved automatically. You have to open the name card file one by one to save them. If you have a lot of contacts, this process is very hectic and lengthy.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-transfer-contacts-from-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-Samsung-Smart-Switch"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-transfer-contacts-from-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-Samsung-Smart-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices using Samsung Smart Switch?"></a>Part 4: How to transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices using Samsung Smart Switch?</h2><p>Samsung launched a new app called “Smart Switch” to allow transfer of content between Android devices. Although, it does not support allAndroid devices.</p><p>To transfer contacts from Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Other Android Devices via this app, follow the below method step by step.</p><p>1. First of all, download the app on both the mobiles.</p><p>2. Then, open this app on new Android device and Start the process by tapping on “Start”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/05/14945045848700.jpg"                      alt="select old device"                ></p><p>3. Now, Select the new device as ‘Receiving device”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/05/14945046092554.jpg"                      alt="select receiving device"                ></p><p>4.
