So what if your contacts have, for some reason, refused to sync? Well, don’t panic; here are some of the possible fixes for the problem.</p><p>Ensure that the Sync option is turned on for your device. To do this, simply:</p><ol><li>Tap on Settings for your device</li><li>Go to Data Usage, then go to Menu.</li><li>Ensure that the “Auto-Sync data” option is active on your device, if not, activate it.</li><li>If it is already turned on, try toggling it on and off a few times, then proceed to Sync your Contacts.</li></ol><p>Ensure that Google Contacts sync is turned on. To do this, simply:</p><ul><li>Once again, go to Android Settings.</li></ul><ol><li>Go to the “Accounts” option.</li><li>Go to the Google Account that you have used as your backup preference.</li><li>Make sure that the “Contacts” option for the sync data is turned on.</li><li>If it is already on and is still not working, try toggling the option on and off a few times.</li></ol><p>Make sure that you have an active Internet connection, and that background data is switched off. The importance of checking your Internet connection before proceeding to more extreme measures for all issues cannot be ignored. The issues that may be disturbing you might be due to an issue with your device’s connection to the Internet</p><ol><li>Switch Off and Switch On your Data Connection.</li><li>Go to Settings, then go to “Data Usage” and ensure that Restricting Background Data is disabled on your device.</li></ol><p>Clear the App Cache for Google Contacts.</p><ol><li>Go to Settings</li><li>Then tap on “Apps” or “Apps Manager,” depending on your device and Android version.</li><li>Go to all Apps and find Contact Sync.</li><li>Select Clear Cache and also Clear Data.</li><li>This should knock the Contacts sync back to normal and ensure that your sync goes on without a hitch from there on out.</li></ol><p>Remove your Google Account and set up again. The issue you are facing might be due to a malfunctioning Google Account setup. To fix this:</p><ol><li>Go to Settings.</li><li>Go to Accounts, then proceed to your Google Account.</li><li>Select the Remove Account option</li><li>Then proceed to set up your email account again.</li></ol><p>As a last-ditch fix, some users have reported that an account merging for the contacts fixed the problems of the contacts not syncing. To do this, do the following steps:</p><ol><li>Go to Contacts</li><li>Tap on the menu, then tap on “Contacts to Display” option</li><li>Select “Only Device”. Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device to display.</li><li>Tap on “Menu” and then on “Merge Accounts”</li><li>Select Google Merge. This will merge all your Contacts with Google.</li><li>Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting “Contacts to Display”, then “All Contacts”</li><li>This should make all the contacts on your device to appear, and your sync problem should also be solved.</li></ol><p>These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account. It is also worthy of note that if you want new contacts to be saved automatically to your Google account, you have to select the Google Account option when prompted on where to save the new contact, or else, the contact will not be automatically synced to your Gmail account, and you will have to create an export to add it to your Google Contacts.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that it might take a longer period of time for the contacts to synchronize to Google on a slower network connection, in deviance to a fast network connection, so you might need to exercise some patience if you’re on a slower Internet connection.</p><p>It can sometimes be bewildering and baffling when people probably lose their phones, and then they complain of loss of contacts. However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts.

To do this, do the following steps:</p><ol><li>Go to Contacts</li><li>Tap on the menu, then tap on “Contacts to Display” option</li><li>Select “Only Device”. Note that this will make only the contacts saved on the Motorola Moto E13 device to display.</li><li>Tap on “Menu” and then on “Merge Accounts”</li><li>Select Google Merge. This will merge all your Contacts with Google.</li><li>Go back and select Menu again, this time selecting “Contacts to Display”, then “All Contacts”</li><li>This should make all the contacts on your device to appear, and your sync problem should also be solved.</li></ol><p>These fixes should ensure that your sync of contacts with the Google Account is now fixed, and you are now able to backup and sync your contacts to your Gmail Account. It is also worthy of note that if you want new contacts to be saved automatically to your Google account, you have to select the Google Account option when prompted on where to save the new contact, or else, the contact will not be automatically synced to your Gmail account, and you will have to create an export to add it to your Google Contacts.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that it might take a longer period of time for the contacts to synchronize to Google on a slower network connection, in deviance to a fast network connection, so you might need to exercise some patience if you’re on a slower Internet connection.</p><p>It can sometimes be bewildering and baffling when people probably lose their phones, and then they complain of loss of contacts. However, you need not worry about such loss of information again in this technological age since there are several ways to backup contacts. All the methods mentioned above are easy to execute and will help you transfer contacts from the phone to Gmail in a snap.</p><p>Lastly, you can also use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html" >Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for smoothly exporting contacts from Motorola Moto E13 to Gmail.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Contacts-from-Motorola-Moto-E13-to-Outlook"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Contacts-from-Motorola-Moto-E13-to-Outlook" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Contacts from Motorola Moto E13 to Outlook"></a>How to Transfer Contacts from Motorola Moto E13 to Outlook</h2><p><em>I would like to export&#x2F;edit my contacts that are on My Motorola Moto E13 and get them onto my computer for a back, to edit them, to input&#x2F;import them into Outlook.

Also, multiple tools and apps can assist you in this context.</p><p>By contrast, it is not feasible to <strong>transfer apps to a new Android phone</strong> from an iPhone. That’s mainly because of the different operating software in the two devices. The applications downloaded in iOS are not compatible with Android.

Unlike transferring photos, moving texts poses a unique challenge as the options available are relatively limited.</p><p>Transferring your messages allows you to keep your important messages intact, preserving cherished conversations and important information. Be it a heartfelt message from a loved one or crucial details in a business conversation, some of your text messages must hold significant sentimental and practical value.</p><p>This article will guide you through effective and easy methods to <strong>transfer texts from Samsung Galaxy S23+ to iPhone</strong>. Let’s explore together the best ways to transfer texts and overcome the hurdles that come with this process.</p><p>When it comes to seamlessly transferring SMS from Samsung Galaxy S23+ to iPhone, Apple’s official app, “Move to iOS,” can be a reliable and straightforward solution. This app is designed to streamline the transfer process, allowing you to move not only your text messages but also other essential data to your iPhone.</p><p>To use this Move to iOS app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store first on your Samsung Galaxy S23+. Then, follow the steps to <strong>transfer SMS from Samsung Galaxy S23+ to iPhone</strong> here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your iPhone. Power up your new iPhone 14 or 15 and progress through the initial setup until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. At this point, select the option that reads “Move Data from Android.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Agree to Terms and Conditions. Open Move to iOS on your Samsung Galaxy S23+. Then, review and tap “Agree” to Terms and Conditions to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the Code. On your Samsung Galaxy S23+, a screen will appear, requesting a 6–10-digit code. This code will be generated on your iPhone. Enter the displayed code on your Samsung Galaxy S23+ to make a secure connection between the two devices.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Content to Transfer. With the Samsung Galaxy S23+ devices now connected, you can choose the types of content you wish to transfer. Select “Text Messages” and any other data you want to move to your new iPhone. Tap “Continue” to initiate the transfer process.</li></ul><p>**Tip:**Keep your devices close to each other and connected to power until the transfer process is completed.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, you will be prompted to finish setting up your iPhone.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Samsung Galaxy S23+ before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Samsung Galaxy S23+, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png"                      border="0"                >Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

Transferring data from one part of the world to another can be done in the blink of an eye. Transferring data from one phone to another should be that simple right? Well, it is if you are using devices with the same OS. But, what should you do if you want to transfer data from, let’s say, Android to BlackBerry? Don’t worry.

And unfortunately, you will sometimes wish that you can speed up this process. You can try to manually transfer data from Samsung Galaxy S23+ to a computer, and then from a computer to BlackBerry, but this process can take hours. It is boring to transfer the files from one place to another, and the time it takes is a real pain in the neck.

But, luckily, the BlackBerry developers have thought of a one way, which is simpler than the manual transfer mentioned above, to transfer your data from Samsung Galaxy S23+ to BlackBerry. It takes less time, but you still need to do some work.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-transfer-data-from-Samsung-Galaxy-S23-to-Blackberry-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-transfer-data-from-Samsung-Galaxy-S23-to-Blackberry-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to transfer data from Samsung Galaxy S23+ to Blackberry (Free)"></a>Part 2: How to transfer data from Samsung Galaxy S23+ to Blackberry (Free)</h2><p>The BlackBerry developers have thought of an app that will help you transfer your contacts, calendar videos and photos from and Android device to a BlackBerry.

There are many ways you can try to quickly <strong>transfer data from Infinix Note 30i to iPhone 15.</strong></p><p>In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to <strong>transfer data from Infinix Note 30i to iPhone 15</strong> conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Transferring-Data-From-Infinix-Note-30i-to-iPhone"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Transferring-Data-From-Infinix-Note-30i-to-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Infinix Note 30i to iPhone"></a>Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Infinix Note 30i to iPhone</h2><p>It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.</p><h3 id="File-Size"><a href="#File-Size" class="headerlink" title="File Size"></a>File Size</h3><p>The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Infinix Note 30i device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Infinix Note 30i to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.</p><h3 id="Device-Storage"><a href="#Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Device Storage"></a>Device Storage</h3><p>Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.</p><h3 id="Operating-Systems"><a href="#Operating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems"></a>Operating Systems</h3><p>Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Infinix Note 30i to iPhone 15 conveniently.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599952&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>Epubor Ultimate for Mac:Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Infinix-Note-30i-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Infinix-Note-30i-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Infinix Note 30i to iPhone 15"></a>5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Infinix Note 30i to iPhone 15</h2><p>Sharing files between Android and iOS smartphones has become a lot easier today than ever before.

Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-Make-sure-the-Wi-Fi-connection-is-turned-on"><a href="#Tip-3-Make-sure-the-Wi-Fi-connection-is-turned-on" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on"></a>Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on</h3><p>Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone’s private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power"><a href="#Tip-4-Plug-both-devices-to-power" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Plug both devices to power"></a>Tip 4: Plug both devices to power</h3><p>You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Honor X50 GT devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode"><a href="#Tip-5-Set-your-phone-into-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode"></a>Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode</h3><p>When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.</p><p>The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement"><a href="#Tip-6-Check-the-storage-requirement" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Check the storage requirement"></a>Tip 6: Check the storage requirement</h3><p>Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don’t need to transfer from your android device before getting started.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BOutlook%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/outlook-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer"><a href="#Tip-7-Disable-the-connection-optimizer" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer"></a>Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer</h3><p>Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices"><a href="#Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices"></a>Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices</h3><p>You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store.

Don’t worry; we’ve got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>1. Interrupted transfer</strong></li></ul><p>The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Oppo Find N3 Flip before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.</p><p>If you navigate away from the “Move to iOS” app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Problems with Wi-Fi connection</strong></li></ul><p>Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.</p><p>To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Oppo Find N3 Flip, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message</strong></li></ul><p>Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.</p><p>For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Back-Up-Messages-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive"></a>Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive</h2><p>In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important.

Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Honor Magic 6 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Honor Magic 6 to iPad&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>Transferring photos from your Honor Magic 6 to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes. To address them, it’s essential to navigate through common mistakes that users often encounter so you won’t make the same errors.</p><p><strong>1. Insufficient battery levels</strong></p><p>Users often attempt photo transfers with low battery levels on either device. For a successful process, it is crucial to make sure that both your Android and iPad&#x2F;iPhone have sufficient battery levels or are connected to power sources during the transfer.</p><p><strong>2. Limited storage space</strong></p><p>Overlooking available storage space on the iPad&#x2F;iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.</p><p><strong>3. Interference from Third-Party Apps:</strong></p><p>Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring file compatibility:</strong></p><p>Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.</p><p><strong>5. Skipping App Permissions:</strong></p><p>When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it’s common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although they work in different operating systems, transferring photos between Android and Apple devices, including iPad and iPhone, can be accomplished through various methods.

Rest assured; the upcoming sections will comprehensively cover these approaches, providing you with the necessary guidance for a smooth music transfer process.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Transfer-Music-from-iPod-to-Android-via-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-1-Transfer-Music-from-iPod-to-Android-via-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Use the sharing or send via Bluetooth option (this may vary depending on your iPod model) to send the selected music files to your Honor Magic 6.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Accept the files on Android.</p><p>Accept the incoming Bluetooth transfer request from the iPod. The music files will then be transferred wirelessly from your iPod to the Android device.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Verify transfer success.</p><p>Confirm the successful transfer by checking the music library on your Honor Magic 6.

You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-step-by-step-guide-for-meet-custom-filters-and-effects/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  A Step-by-Step Guide for Meet Custom Filters & Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-master-of-mayhem-top-10-roguelites/"><u>[New] Master of Mayhem  Top 10 Roguelites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-quickly-locating-your-curated-music-compilation-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Quickly Locating Your Curated Music Compilation on Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-best-free-winpodcast-tools-compilation/"><u>[Updated] Best Free WinPodcast Tools Compilation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-make-highlights-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] How to Make Highlights on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/addrom-bypass-an-android-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-for-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-by-drfone-android/"><u>AddROM Bypass An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Xiaomi Redmi K70</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/farm-fun-quest-the-leading-10-farm-themed-gaming-titles-for-2024/"><u>Farm Fun Quest  The Leading 10 Farm-Themed Gaming Titles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/file-forwarding-made-easy-top-5-methods-to-upload-directly-on-pc/"><u>File Forwarding Made Easy  Top 5 Methods to Upload Directly on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-do-i-sign-a-word-2021-electronically-by-ldigisigner-sign-a-word-sign-a-word/"><u>How do i sign a Word 2021 electronically</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-samsung-galaxy-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Location On Facebook Dating for your Samsung Galaxy A05s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-pro-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Remove Forgotten PIN Of Your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-see-someones-location-on-apple-iphone-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to See Someones Location on Apple iPhone 8 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-honor-x7b-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Honor X7b to Samsung Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-music-from-huawei-nova-y71-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Music from Huawei Nova Y71 to iPod | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-videos-from-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-to-ipad-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Videos from Samsung Galaxy A15 5G to iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-card-on-tecno-pova-5-online-without-jailbreak-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock SIM Card on Tecno Pova 5 online without jailbreak</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-use-phone-clone-to-migrate-your-oneplus-nord-ce-3-lite-5g-data-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Use Phone Clone to Migrate Your OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G Data?

The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices"><a href="#Tip-8-Check-the-compatibility-of-your-devices" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices"></a>Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices</h3><p>You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store.

How to transfer music from Itel A60s to Other Android Devices using NFC?</h2><p>NFC or Near Field Communication is another wireless means to transfer music from Itel A60s to Other Android Devices. Although, unlike Bluetooth, this method requires contact between the two devices making the transfer.</p><p><strong>Below are the steps on how to transfer music from Itel A60s to Other Android Devices using NFC.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First, enable NFC connection on both the Itel A60s devices between which you want to transfer the music files. To switch on NFC on Android, go to Phone’s “Settings” and click on “More Settings” under “Wireless and Network” options. Now click on the NFC button to ensure that it is switched On. Do the same on the other Android device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-11.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-click on “More Settings”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Before you begin to transfer, you need to touch the back of both devices (whose NFC has already been turned on), you will notice that both devices vibrate upon a successful connection.
